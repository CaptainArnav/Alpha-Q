" Tied for the best movie I have ever seen
",,"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."
" A classic piece of unforgettable film-making.
",spoiler,"In its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank Darabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked away with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were ""just happy to be nominated."" Of course hindsight is 20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however, was a success from the word ""go,"" making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure wasn't a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on ""that 'Rickshaw' movie."" Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, ""it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale."" But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; ""In here's where you need it most,"" he says. ""You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch."" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking ""that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass"" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it.It's pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the same actors, it is easy to forget that the movie's timeline spans well over 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it's not as if the film lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it's going, it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off as well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more exhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be forgotten.With themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to be found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ figure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard Nixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they come. But if you aren't looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to anyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving film, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don't come much better than this.OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? As Andy says, ""It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying."""
" Prepare to be moved
",,"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams.  And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.  Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message.  Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him.  Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.  You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie."
" This is How Movies Should Be Made
",,"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want."
" Don't Rent Shawshank.
",,"I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time. Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame. But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title."
" Shawshank Redeems Hollywood
",,"Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability.  Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget."
" Some birds aren't meant to be caged.
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10"
" Eternal Hope
",,"I've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.I have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.For me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.Brilliant, brilliant movie and a must see for everyone."
" Stephen King's best adapted movie
",,"Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come."
" The Shawshank Redemption
",,"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years."
" Two movies in one
",spoiler,"The reason I became a member of this database is because I finally  found a movie ranking that recognized the true greatness of this movie. There  is nary a word or scene out of place in the entire thing. Every element  comes together to form an exquisite story for cinema.   I believe that one reason that this movie is under-appreciated is that  people have not seen it multiple times. On first viewing it is the story of  Andy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances.   However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find  meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find a different path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope.  Who is your Andy Dufresne?"
" Simply known as ""The Movie""
",,"Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as ""The Movie"".  When I say ""The Movie"", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about.  In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption.  Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those ""Budget Theaters"" over the summer of 1995.  None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good.  So, not having any real expectations, we saw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There's really no other way I can put it in words.  Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... ""HOPE"".  This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history!  How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see.  I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films.  However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!""  There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my ""favorite of all time"", but they've all fallen far short of ""The Shawshank Redemption"". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately.  You're guaranteed to find it in the ""employee picks"" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this movie, go see it again.  If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating???  I give it a 13!!!!!!"
" Simply amazing. The best film of the 90's.
",spoiler,"The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10"
" its an excellent piece of art
",,"i watch this movie for minimum 5-6 times first to last. so every time i enjoyed as i watching it first time. its a piece of art. and we now know how to entertain with no action or fighting scenes. its a pure drama that anyone can enjoy with family in silence. so i rate this movie 10 out of 10 because of amazing screen play, acting, casting, background scoring editing etc. this is my first movie review so pardon me if i did any mistake."
" The absolute GREATEST movie of all time.
",spoiler,"My life is forever changed due to this movie.  It is a movie of hope, ""redemption"", and friendship.  It shows a deep growing friendship between two prisoners, Andy and Red.  They each are shown growing through their distinct hardships at Shawshank prison.  As time passes, hope wanes but a flame burns bright in Andy.  His hope and unrelentless nature carry over to his friend Red.As Red's long stay in prison comes to an end he sees the light at the end of the tunnel.  Andy has left it for him to see the way to freedom, and he follows it.This film parallels my life and leaves me wondering if my advice will help somebody see the light.  For some of those people time will tell.  As for now I'll be patient to wait and see.  Don't end up like Brooks, there will always be someone to help you out.  There is someone out there that cares for you.  Thank you Andy Dufresne, your hope is the flame of my life."
" The best story ever told on film
",spoiler,"I believe that this film is the best story ever told on film, and I'm about to tell you why.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or cliched, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all other films, is the attention given to the story. The film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It's a powerful, poignant, thought-provoking, challenging film like no other. If Andy were to comment on this film, I think he might say: ""Get busy watching, or get busy dying."" Take his advice.Thoroughly recommended."
" Oh my godmother

So WHY do people love this movie and rate it high, when, or WHY isn't the ""smart"" people declare it like a a peace of art? Or do they?! Still I think it's darn good...but I bet the producer(s) didn't expect that!Like when we vote, for anything, we need to follow our heart. This is a typical movie that is worth every penny, every letter... and it's a typical 90' movie! Oh.. there we have it! Between gone with the wind and now, we NEED this! Love me as I am.. says the storyline, in my head anyway. And I do, yes I do!"
" This is a wonderful movie!!!!
",,"When I first see it, I am too young to understand all the things the movie what to show us. The film gave me a very different feeling. Hope is a dangerous thing, is the root of mental distress. Because since come in the day, the warden said, ""the soul to god, the body to me.""Except that he can get the cigarettes and naked woman printed CARDS and any other changes I can't seem to grow within the walls of the dark. However Andy told him, ""remember, hope is a good thing - and perhaps even good. And no good thing will never disappear."" So Andy can use 20 years digging Red think can chisel in tunnel in six hundred.When he finally climbed out of the five hundred yards of the stench of sewage pipes, standing in the pouring rain can't help, we seem to see faith Pierce heavy darkness, played a luminous in the dark of the night out of the blue.Under the light, the soul of our weak under Andy with open arms in the sky in succession, and shaking."
" From my favorite movies..
",,"It is one of the best movies in the world that many people will join me. Watching very, very impressed. What it might be called the great stories of Stephen King anyway. Acting on cues can say is enormous. There's no posturing. Especially when Andy Dufrense incredible music that review still stands wandering on everyone's lips. Finale as you lose yourself in it is a movie you are getting into. Finals if he so exhilarating you a high-quality music. And finding that deserves really deserve. I watched this film very young age and it has taught me that the magic of cinema in a nice way. This film is one of the reasons I hate the Oscars. Will remain as the best film in more than 10 years, I believe wholeheartedly sites. Definitely one of the best films in the world."
" Busy dying or busy living?
",spoiler,"**Yes, there are SPOILERS here**This film has had such an emotional impact on me, I find it hard to write comments on it.  I've read a lot of the previous comments; all those that gush and eulogise as well as those who think it's over-rated or cliched. Most have got good points to make, however the thing that I think everyone is struggling to both explain and come to terms with is just why this film is *so* loved.  Loved to the extent that for many it is an almost spiritual experience or for those of a more secular nature like myself, loved as one of the most devastatingly uplifting things that can happen to you while watching a film.So I'm not going to review it, I'm just going to struggle in my own way to explain this film.  It took me a few viewings to get why I connect with it so deeply, but here goes.Many people in this world are unhappy.  Most people in this world don't want to be unhappy.  Lots of people wish, pray and above all hope for that magic wand to wave and wash them of their fears, losses, angers and pains once and for all.  They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state, while they suffer.  To borrow the words of another film, they're watching the bluebirds flying over the rainbow.Many unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesn't exist. They're not destined to join the bluebirds and fairytales don't come true.  It's not that no one lives happily ever after, it's just that they're not going to. They're busy dying.In this film, or as some people have quite correctly said, this fairytale, magic wands exist.  And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense imitating Houdini. However this film is not about him.  Neither is it about the prison, the governor, the guard, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, the script, the direction or the score.It's about Red.  He is the one who has become institutionally unhappy, he's not only trapped in a prison, not only has he given up on the idea of ever leaving, not only does he have no hope, he knows that if the miracle would ever happen to him, he couldn't cope.  He's safe in his unhappiness and that security is what keeps him going.  Hope is, as Red say, dangerous.  The metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and I know that a rather large number of people suffer from it.  A large proportion of those don't understand what's wrong, but they certainly can recognise a fellow sufferer.  Those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely don't understand what's going on in those who do.  They're too busy living.The miracle in this film is not only that Red is redeemed but that the world outside the prison isn't all warm and sandy and sunny and with excellent fishing.  Some of it is rocky and uncertain.  Fairytales don't get this far. They'd end as Red left the gates of the prison and the credits would say 'and he lived happily ever after'.  This is the only film I can currently think of where they show how to get to the living happily ever after bit from your redemption via the rocky and uncertain ground of bagging groceries at the local store.  In other words, they're not going to cheat you and tell you everything's going to be alright.This is crucial.  For two and half hours, those of us who are quite content to mooch around our own personal prisons can see an escape route quite different to Andy's mapped out on the screen.  And it's a real way out. It's hard and upsetting, but ultimately rewarding.  The high you get from finding out and knowing that is only comparable diamorphine.The trouble is, if you're already busy living, this film won't mean that much and you'll see it a little more clearly than those busy dying.  To those fortunate individuals, watch this film and understand what the rest of us are going through.So, yes, this film is a cliched fairytale and maybe as a story it isn't realistic and at second on the IMDb all time list, it is a bit over-rated. However if you could have a chart of films listing the number of lives saved, altered and improved, the Shawshank Redemption would be way out in front at number one."
" Prison thriller with violence, hatred, corruption, friendship and joy.
",,"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a timeless story of heartbreak, deception and ultimate growth under the most deplorable conditions. The acting is superior, some of Tim Robbins' and Morgan Freeman's best work as they allow me an intimate look inside the sometimes contradictory nature of a convict's existence, where I am torn emotionally between danger and safety, light and shadow, sanity and sorrow, truth and lies, injustice and justice. In fact, I am lost in all the actors' poignant and memorable portrayals of young thugs, cruel guards, swindlers, thieves, rapists and murders, all standing in their respective spaces quietly listening together to an operatic aria over a loudspeaker on the prison yard.In this movie, I find almost no one to be all good or all bad. There are exceptions, though. Although there are those in charge of the prison I wish to be caught in a snare of their own making or worse, there are still others behind prison walls that turn out to be heroes I cheer on to win in the end. Like people in real life, most of the characters in ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" both prisoners and guards (those that are not miserably rotten to the bone), represent many shades of gray.One of the most touching moments in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a scene in which an elderly convict, who has spent the better part of his adult life locked up, is brokenheartedly paroled into a modern world that is as alien to him as his outdated suit and boyhood memories. And his fear of this new and unnatural terrain, crawling with shadier creatures than those he had known behind bars and the exhaust fumes of a thousand horseless carriages rushing past, engulfed him with no hope of ever escaping.""Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free,"" from ""The Shawshank Redemption.""As bonds form between people of different ethnic groups, economic backgrounds and intellectual levels, I rejoice in their discovery of the human dignity they share. As the story unfolds, my heart hurts so hard, I cry. Then, with tears still in my eyes, I laugh, the same way my family used to laugh together at dinner or a movie when I was a little girl.Getting older. Times changing. People leaving. Dying. But at the core of the main character's spirit there shines upon all those who are within its range, including me, a contagious hope eternal. I am still astonished with the euphoria that fills my being each time I view this incredible story about the invincible human spirit."
" Greatest movie of all time!
",,"This movie is one of my all time favorites. Undoubtedly, one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Story, cast, screenplay all are great. The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing, and couldn't be more accurate. It was narrated by Morgan Freeman, who is the best narrator in Hollywood, I believe. Actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It will change the way u think about things around u. Surely, It will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see. If you haven't watch it yet, just GO! Watch it! Now!"
" A movie revolution upon all others
",,"We have all see movies, comedies, action and dramas. We all liked ones, hated others, got into some other even and felt like part of it. In Shawshank Redemption; you start slowly, after a while you get attached, by the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget about anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions going through you head before anything else! then comes a last 20 minutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline to extreme levels even in diabetics! I felt warm, strong, happy and all other emotions one can think of, I felt I was the one who won, who got out of prison, i was simply fully satisfied.This movie must be used as an Anti-depression by therapists! this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts! or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldn't give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the Oscars.. it's simply over qualified!"
" Great story, wondrously told and acted
",spoiler,"At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get things, the ""only"" guilty man at Shawshank prison. He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn't win. (Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump.) What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.But Freeman is not alone. Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story, banker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays. It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing. I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the Bible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden Samuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy. I want to tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is revealed. They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent, predatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated R). On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten contents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words ""His judgment cometh and that right soon."" The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect. You will take delight, I promise.Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you. As most people know, it was adapted from a novella by Stephen King entitled ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption."" Rita Hayworth figures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that he pins up on the wall of his cell. The poster is a still from the film Gilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford. We see a clip from the black and white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita Hayworth appears. If you haven't seen her, check out that old movie. She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next appears on Andy's wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955). It's the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs. Following her on Andy's wall (and, by the way, these pinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million Years B.C. (1966). In a simple and effective device these pinups show us graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.Frank Darabont's direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story. There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out after fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can't cope with life on the outside and hangs himself. Playing off of this is Red's periodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is summarily REJECTED. Watch how this plays out at the end.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent. The editing superb: there's not a single dead spot in the whole movie. The difference between the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the warden, the guards, the ""sisters,"" etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn, and perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might be realistic, and perhaps the ""redemption"" is a bit too miraculous in how beautifully it works out. But never mind. We love it.All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul. It is not a chick flick, and that is an understatement. It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.Bottom line: one of the best ever made, currently rated #2 (behind The Godfather) at the IMDb. Don't miss it.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)"
" Hope can set you free and so can this remarkable film
",,"One of my favorite movies ever,The Shawshank Redemption is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes place.Based on a Stephen King novel,this movie makes us feel different watching this film than most others as this is an incredibly realistic film.Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne who is convicted of murder and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding who is a fellow inmate and close friend of Dufresne and Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton who is the Warden of Shawshank State Prison and is a character who has mixed feelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who is sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despise.This film is easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I definitely agree with this fact.It was nominated for seven Academy Awards including (Best Picture, Best Actor  Morgan Freeman, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound) but didn't win any due to tough competition from the film Forrest Gump.I personally think that Tim Robbins should have been nominated for the Best Actor award as he really gave the performance of his career.Bravo to this brilliant modern day classic!"
" The closest thing to poetic perfection Hollywood has ever produced
",,"This touching and heart warming film is the most perfect celebration of the human spirit I have seen. Andy Dufresne, wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, finds the strength not only to change himself, but to bring hope to those around him in Shawshank Prison.  This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion, from haunting and chilling, to stirring and beautiful. When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry, music, and its atmosphere, and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction, it is a triumph.  Field of Dreams was the first movie which invoked these emotions in me.  Shawshank Redemption is even more powerful for its simplicity.  It doesn't pretend to be clean, nor could it be called a family movie.  It is brutal and violent at times, horrifying and sickening at others. However the title says it all. Redemption is what this story is all about.  And it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have committed, but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life.  What emerges can only be called a maginificent piece of art.  This is what movies were meant to be."
" Good , But It Is Overrated By Some
",spoiler,"In recent years the IMDB top 250 movies has had THE GODFATHER at number 1 while THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION has remained at number 2 . The only exception was early in 2002 when FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING topped the chart for a couple of months then dropped down to number 2 for a couple of more months . I`ll probably make myself very unpopular for saying this but I don`t think SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION deserves to be so high !!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!!What I don`t like about it is the amount of cliches . New prisoner arrives and finds a maggot in his food , prison cliche 37 . New prisoner gives maggot to old prisoner to feed his pet bird , prison cliche 43 . It`s revealed at the end that the prisoner who has spent so many years inside is innocent after all , prison cliche numero uno . Did anyone believe during any part of this movie that Andy Dufresne was guilty ? Neither did I . Maybe that`s why I love the American prison series OZ because all the inmates there are totally guilty . There`s other things wrong with the movie . It`s about half an hour overlong , and there`s rather unrealistic bits like the warder having someone killed after finding out Dufresne is probably innocent. Oh and how many prison friendships has there been between a black man and a white man ? Maybe that last point shouldn`t be taken as a criticism because the performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are very good and make the movie . Neither of them give a flashy performance ( Again not a criticism ) but both are very subtle in their roles , can you imagine how different this movie would have been if we`d had Tom Cruise and Denzil Washington as the stars ? Perhaps because Freeman`s character of Red does seem to have been written as a white character he`s so good in the role . Am I alone in thinking Freeman has been the best black actor in Hollywood for the last decade because he`s more interested in exploring the character instead of playing someone who`s black ? There`s also some outstanding touches from director Frank Darabont . Witness the scene early in the film where Andy spends his first night in prison with the darkness falling upon the prisoners faces . It`s almost like the artwork of Andy Dogg as the prisoners look out onto the landing as they search for fresh prey , and there is quite a touching sequence as Red leaves prison out into the harsh outside world to the strains of Thomas Newman`s scoreI gave THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION eight out of ten . It is a classic feel good movie but unfortunately being a cynic I do think it`s slightly overrated by IMDB voters"
" life changing
",,"I first saw this film, like many others, by chance and on DVD. And like others, I have since watched it over and over again. When I feel sad, it makes me feel happy, when I need hope, it gives me hope.When I want to reaffirm my very belief in life, and all it can offer, this film gives me a new sense of purpose that no other film has ever come close to doing.It soars above anything any other movie has tried to achieve in the way it touches on the true virtues of life itself. The portrayal of friendship, the devastation of loss and the maintaining of hope. Outstanding performances from the two leads and the most beautiful of narratives are the tip of the iceberg of why this film is so great. The cinematography from the very first shots of the prison are stunning and the accompanying soundtrack add to the haunting atmosphere when we first venture inside the prison walls. Thank you Mr Darabont, Mr Robins and Mr Freeman. Thank you to every one else involved. You changed my life"
" Awesome movie - The Shawshank Redemption (1994)
",,"It's very rare that you find such diversity in a movie now days. I like the story and it's concept.A thumping good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twister of twists since ""The Crying Game."" The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful and uplifting, not to mention Oscar-worthy film. In 2006, it was ranked as the greatest film ever by Empire, a film magazine. The year it came out it was nominated for 7 academy awards but did not win a single one because of a movie you may all remember, Forrest Gump. It's the no-bull performances that hold back the flood of banalities. Robbins and Freeman connect with the bruised souls of Andy and Red to create something undeniably powerful and moving. Some of ""The Shawshank Redemption'' comes across as outrageously improbable. Yet the film keeps pulling you back with its sense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil."
" My own personal view
",,"I don't care if there are some poor souls who would like to belittle this film. Just think of these misfits as beyond redemption.I saw this film in 1995 and still vividly felt the euphoria of the final half hour which stayed with me for a couple of weeks.I was convinced this was the best film I had ever seen in my life, even better than Akira Kurosawa's Ran and One flew over the cuckoo's nest, which was my all time favorite until TSR came along.I excitedly contacted my best friend who shared the same passion and he confirmed my thoughts,""this must be the best film I've ever seen!"" But it is sad though that I will probably never see a better film for the rest of my life as I have seen the best.In music I have heard the best in Rush and Jackson Browne which made others pale in comparison and in movies I have TSR.Hail Frank Darabont!"
" What a touching movie !
",,"It is really amazing movie i have ever seen in my lifetime. The cast and the story of the movie are really successful. Andy is a passionate character, and he is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. It is so touching to spend almost two decades in the prison. Old-fashioned prisons in the 90s are full of bad guy who don't expect anything from the life. And , they don't think how we escape here. However; Andy with his close friend in the prison , Red , tries redemption from this prison, by the time , Andy tries to do beneficial things for people in the prison not to attract attention. It is unbelievable that they escape from this prison. But , Andy approaches to place of exit. It is actually amazing , it is really incredible. They go to their dreams to live a peaceful and quiet life. Also; Andy prepares a trap for the chief of the jail. After the redemption , they become free anymore. It is really an amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well!"
" Hope......Don't loose it at any cost
",,"The 'Shawshank Redemption' undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie. The movie depicts how a four lettered word 'Hope' brings wonders to our lives and makes something impossible to possible.Though the plot of the movie focuses on how Andy Dufrane, a falsely convicted prisoner gets out of the prison, the beauty of the movie lies in the characterization of Andy Dufrane (just amazing) and how he influences his fellow prisoner 'Red'. The narration by Morgan Freeman in the role of 'Red' is perhaps one of the best narrations i have ever come across. This story proves that the king of horrors, Stephen King, is equally good at any other genre of 'Story Writing'(Hats off). The dialogues towards the end of the movie about hope are truly inspiring. The background score of the movie is excellent. Tom Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their best in the roles of Andy Dufrane and Red respectively.Didn't watch the movie??...go grab a DVD and watch it as soon as possible. Can't miss a movie like this...."
" Better Late Then Never
",,"Along with Q and Pulp Fiction, Frank Darabont (The Walking Dead original writer) and his debut film got screwed by the Hollywood Powerhouse that is Tom Hanks with this now can be considered an American Classic. The fact that this film barely and I emphasize barely made it's money back in US theaters (which is usually a signal for a film to turn into a DOA when released at home) and it made such a splash, that the film is exceeding what anyone thought a simple 18 years ago. This includes some of Hollywood's best critics including EW's Owen Gleiberman who originally gave the film a B- back in late '94. Yet over time, this story of redemption, like the rise of hope this film gives from beginning to end, grows on you to the point where at the very end, you have no choice but to clap (I clapped in my basement in front of my parents and I haven't looked the same since). Darabont found a formula that worked and it shows in his future films. He made Robbins human, made Morgan Freeman's voice as American as a Big Mac and made the late great Rita Hayworth relevant again. The only regret that one should have is the fact that if it was released two years later it would've swept away the Oscars (Sorry Ralph Fiennes, The English Patient won on a weak year.)"
" A Truly Uplifting Film
",,Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the most uplifting and touching film I have ever seen. It is the only movie I've seen that has made tears of happiness come to my eyes. I would (and do) recommend this film to anyone and everyone.
" Good movie, but best of all time? Hardly . . .
",,"I was a little surprised at first to see this film ranked #1 out of all possible candidates in the IMDB user ratings. When I thought about it, though, it made more sense--this is a ""Rocky""-type feel-good movie that doesn't really make you think and reinforces what we would all like to believe about human nature. Don't get me wrong--it's a fine film (I gave it a solid 7 out of 10), it's just not, in my view, up there with _Casablanca_ and _The Graduate_.I guess the main problem I have with _Shawshank_ is the nature of the script and characters. Think about it: is there a single person in the film who isn't a one-dimensional cardboard cut-out with very simple motivations, or a Hollywood cliche or stereotype? We have (in no particular order), a corrupt, bigoted prison warden (who is a religious hypocrite for good measure), a brutal prison guard, a man who is wrongly accused of murder, an old convict who knows all the ropes and can't live on the outside, and a convict who is murdered by the brutal guards. Now where have we seen this stuff before? Only in a few dozen movies made from the 20s to the 90s. There's really nothing new here. Probably this comes from the fact that the story is from Stephen King, who doesn't really do well with complex characters (a problem I noted as far back as _Carrie_).If you want to see a good prison picture, try _Cool Hand Luke_ (from which this movie borrows considerably). If you want an escape picture, see either _The Great Escape_ or _Papillon_, both with Steve McQueen. Or if, by some chance, you want a crime and punishment movie that really makes you think, go with the late great Stanley Kubrick's _A Clockwork Orange_.I couldn't stop thinking about the warden: doesn't he have a family? How did they feel? What are they going to do now? I realize the story is inside the prison, but I wish the movie had made better use of its characters than simply as simple-minded symbols of EVIL or VIRTUE.I'm not Mr. Cranky, I did enjoy the movie, but I enjoyed it the same way I do an Italian dinner at the Olive Garden--a well-constructed genre product with nothing special to commend it."
" This is one of the most inspiring n one of the greatest film.
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie. I watched this movie for the umpteenth time. A movie I would never ever get bored of. Written & directed by Frank Darabont, this prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship & redemption. Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison. The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best I have heard. Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith. The more times you watch it, the more you love it, and the more you learn from it. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest film. It has everything you could possibly want in a movie. If you don't love Shawshank, chances are you are beyond redemption. It is hard to find a more proper word for the film than a masterpiece. It's in my top five movies of all time. I feel so bad about not writing a review of this masterpiece during the late nineties."
" One of the best movies ever made?
",,"Probably yes, acting was good, plot brilliant, I mean Stephen King wrote the book, but it can't match the film. When I sow this movie I thought ""thats it, this is it, best movie ever"". Sure you can find people who didn't like it, and when I ask ""why"", and try to guess what then happened? They just confused themselves, they can say reason why they don't like this movie... When I try to read comments with 1/10 star, I can't find comment with good reasons that could make me realize, that this movie is a bad movie, If there is no reason, then this means, that its the best movie ever made!The only reason people are giving 1 star is that they don't like ratio ""9,2"", they want to do more effect by pull this high ratio down, I really hate them :) Sorry for my bad English language, I live in EUrope, my English teacher is big cow with no knowledge..."
" Mystery
",,"I still can't quite get the enormous reputation of this film. I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery, the mystery got thicker. It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore etc, but...the most highly rated film ever? I don't get it. The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what we're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives. The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey. Credible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without asking too many questions. Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a masterpiece? No. Good, even very good? Yes."
" For the first time the Movie defeats the Book!
",,"As an omnivorous reader movies are always second to books to me. I believe....movie can never defeat the book because while reading book we use our own imagination....and movie narrows down the imagination.....it only allows us to see how the director has imagined the book.But Believe me...this is not the case of The Shawshank Redemption...which I rate as the best movie I have ever seen.For the first time in history the book(the Stephen King Novella) has been defeated by its movie version.After watching the movie I was crazy about reading the book....I thought wow!the movie is so good...how will be the book!!To tell U frankly,the book is good, but the movie is best.There are some unforgettable scenes in the movie which were not in the book.Some examples are: The scene when Andy locks up the guard and play the opera on the microphone.The narration goes on like..""I didn't understand a single word that Italian lady was singing...but I tell U..for that single second every soul in the Shawshank prison felt free...""The scene just fill my heart with Andy's yearn for freedom...I was kinda shocked when I didn't find it in the original book version.I can remember another scene.While Andy creates the prison library and starts listing books sent to prison from charity organizations...a fellow inmate tries to read a name on the book...Alexandre Dumas as ""Dumb-Ass"". Andy says....""its not Dumb-ass...its Dumas..and U may like the book..The Count of Monty Cristo...its about a jailbreak.And the category it falls is Fiction"" Then Red says..""Why don't we put it on Educational category?""(Right before Andy listed an engineering handbook as ""Educational"" category).As Count of Monticristo is one of my favorite books, I was hysteric watching this sophisticated joke.This was also not in the book.This DVD is my favorite gift I give my friends. And after they watch it....they always thank me . Like many other IMDb friends commenting on this movie..I would also like to say..""Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I have ever seen in my life"".Thanx to all."
" Relentless Storytelling
",,"I reviewed this film recently with a specific question in mind. At this writing, this film is ranked by IMDB viewers as the second best film ever made. The SECOND BEST EVER MADE!Why? This was my question.The acting is good. Robbins and Freeman are quality craftsmen in the Caine and Hackman tradition. But these are not truly great actors and in any case, they are only asked to play appealing persons, deliberately less-dimensional than real (as opposed to believably hyper-real which is much harder).The director is a first-timer, and it shows. There is simple framing and staging here. In fact, there seems to be a deliberate strategy to be as plain as possible. And that is the core of where I think people find the appeal of this film.The story is very tight in the sense of narrative flow. All the chunks are the same size, with no fancy rhythm. There is no distracting backstory. No element has irony, not writing, acting, shooting, even the score.Now for me, I expect and demand art in my films -- that's why I register this as plain. But I think it is well liked because it is totally without pretense. It is straight and honest; people seem hungry for honesty, and this has the appearance of what they need at just the right time.Is a film great because it merely fulfills? I hope many people think not, and dream that this film moves down the list to be replaced with more intelligent efforts."
" The greatest movie ever made..!
",,"The greatest movie ever made..! Period. Pure and simple, it is what every director hope to achieve. The film will keep you glued to your seat if you know what it means.It will bring tears to your eyes. It will make you think how you have lived your life so far...or in fact how you have wasted it. It will teach you the value of freedom which we enjoy without giving a second thought. And it will leave you with a sense of happiness which you will experience only rarely. The performances are simply mind boggling, be it Tim Robbins or Morgan Freeman or countless others. And it is difficult to believe this was the debut of Frank Darabont as a director.If you haven't already seen it... please do, otherwise you are missing something."
" Masterpiece
",,"Shawshank Redemption, The (1994) **** (out of 4) An innocent man (Tim Robbins) is sent to prison on murder charges and once there he bonds with another man (Morgan Freeman) serving a life sentence. I remember seeing this when it was first released to theaters and walking out thinking it was a masterpiece but apparently others couldn't be bothered to see it since the box office results were very low and it was out of theaters in no time. Over the years the reputation of this film has grown and as I write this it's currently #1 at IMDb. I certainly wouldn't call this the greatest film ever made but it's certainly one of them. I think it's an insult to call this a prison movie because it's so much more than that. This is a film about friendship and hope. Those are two things that have played major parts in many movies but I can't think of too many films where the payoff is as large. What makes the film work so well is that director Durabont takes his time telling a story that takes place over twenty years. Another wonderful thing the director does is that he really makes the twenty years pass on a believable manor. Most films that jump time feel cheap and rushed but that's not the case here because the wonderful screenplay lets us get to know the two main character but also the supporting characters are very well written. What really brings this magic to life are the performances, which are downright brilliant and I'd argue that you can see some of the greatest ensemble acting right in this film. Robbins and Freeman are terrific together and really make for one of the most memorable friendships in movie history. The way Robbins walks and talks is perfectly done and I just love the way, as Freeman says in his narration, he walks around as if he didn't have a care in the world. Freeman gives another wonderful performance but what's really great about him is the narration he adds as he tells us the story. James Whitmore is terrific as the elderly convict and Clancy Brown and Bob Gunton make for excellent villains. I won't spoil the ending for anyone but the final twenty-minutes are at times breathtaking in their beauty and it's message of hope rings louder than most movies."
" What's SO special?
",spoiler,"This is a good movie, and surely is right up there among the finest prison/concentration camp depictions which almost ALWAYS have at least competent quality. In my mind I compare this genre to ""submarine""-films: confined space, lots of guys under constant threat, therefore drama and tension easily created without much sweat (ha ha). But also with obvious problems in providing something new. The same situations and characters are presented just from here to eternity, and I rest my case with this movie in question as follows: despotic warden, sadistic guard/s, evil fellow inmates who want to kill/rape you but also few trusted friends (along with that one old timer and his inevitable sad ending) and finally escape by the main protagonist who of course has been convicted in the first place based on false accusations or at least something not-so-bad crime.So what's so special here? 9.1/10, come on... Maybe the same tricks worked here as in that other Stephen King's hit-penitentiary-drama ""The Green Mile"", i.e. manipulative scenes and quickly identified cardboard characters. Or maybe the majority of movie-goers consider what they're watching at face value and never mind that ""I've seen this all before""-feel. Or maybe they haven't or just have a lousy memory? Yes I admit, I'm something of a cynic. But I also believe I'm able to spot an truly honest effort when I see one. Probably that's the reason why I consider the grandpa of them all, Mervyn LeRoy's 1932 ""I'm A Fugitive From A Chain Gang"" as the all-time best prison-flick. No film-snobbery here, as I hope you'll agree when you see this true classic."
" The shortest long movie I've ever seen. Kept me wanting more and more, minute by minute.
",,"At first, before starting the movie, I thought ""Sounds like a typical prison riot and break-out kind of movie"". At the beginning of the movie, my thoughts was even more convincing. A large prison (Which immediately reminded me of the movie ""The Last Castle"" from 2001), housing people of all sorts, having it's guards, warden and of course, the inmates. The typical inmate; Roughneck, hard on the outside, broken on the inside. And they all claim their innocence, as an internal joke sort of speak.It gets to a point where I started comparing it with others. That proved wrong in quite a short while, from the point where a prisoner, framed for murder of his wife and her lover, is being convicted and sentenced to life in prison. His name was Andy Dufresne. In short terms, a straight-up bank employee, excellent with numbers and taxes, which he also uses to benefit within the walls of the prison. His reputation as a numerological genius spreads out, and soon all kinds of people, inmates and guards, are coming to him for financial advice. He builds up a library, he maintains a strict surface. He has his hobbies, to keep his mind busy (as said in the movie). He carves chess pieces out of stone, using an axe as the tool. Seemingly, this is a nice and lucrative hobby, but underneath it all, he has a secret...The movie keeps the viewer thrilled and excited, because in every minute, something could happen. The dialog is good, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, both great actors, shows and outstanding play. The crew really did good work on the set, the right camera angles, the light, sounds and so on...it was almost like I could smell the prison!A brilliant movie. Not too short, not too long. It's worth every minute watching! My highest recommendation for those who like drama, action and humor."
" The Greatest Movie of all Time
",,"Could a movie be any more perfect? This movie is just absolutely stunning in so many ways. Acting perfect, storyline perfect, soundtrack perfect, emotional drama perfect, everything about this movie is perfect.When this movie first came out it did not reach the expectations that many people expected it to. But as the years went one it was nominated for seven Academy Awards and as it was available for rent everywhere more people started appreciating it and it's popularity grew. Eventually after many years in the top 5 of IMDb's top 250 movies of all time list, it hit number 1 with over one million votes.The story is about a well educated vice president of a large bank being wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to spend life at a large prison in new England called Shawshank prison. As the years go on in his new home he makes friends, enemys and a dramatic twist at the end which became one of the most legendary scenes in movie history.I love this movie. The acting is just so passionate and their performances increases the drama and horror of life in prison. The soundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this movie. Many scenes in this movie almost left me in tears mainly because of the soundtrack in the background which increases the emotion. The cast of this movie include Academy Awards winners Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. And also William Sadler, Bob Gunton and many other who made this movie what it is.Overall it is defiantly the Greatest movie ever made with passionate acting, great storyline and plenty of emotional drama about how hope overcomes fear in a beautifully crafted film about the strength of the human spirit."
" Over Rated
",,"There is no denying that this is a very good movie. The acting is great and it tells a good story. Personally, I find it a bit too long and a little too sweet for my taste, but its far from a bad film. On the other end of the spectrum I have yet to understand why this film was nominated for as many Oscars as it was and why so many people have fallen in love with it. To place it on the same level as The Godfather and several hundred other films has to be the result of different tastes.
This is a film that should be seen because its a good movie, not because its a great one."
" Best movie of all time!
",,"The first time I ever saw this movie I was just floored at how incredible it was. What wonderful casting that was done to help this amazing story be told. Stephen King has a way about creating such memorable characters. For those of you who think this movie is a ""prison movie"" you are sadly mistaken. This movie merely takes place in a prison but this story is about so much more...friendship, hope, survival and dreams! There is a reason this movie is voted #1 on the IMDb site! Not only have I enjoyed watching this movie over a hundred times but I have been lucky enough to have been in that prison numerous times doing paranormal events. My last visit out there was last weekend and I decided to also go and visit all of the filming locations! That was a real treat! All I can say is that if you have not seen this film just take the time to watch it and just take in the amazing story and the incredible performances turned in by the cast! I promise you that you won't be sorry!!!"
" really superb

" The UNIVERSALITY of Shawshank:. Andy Dufresne as ""EVERYMAN""
",,"........................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL If you have never seen SHAWSHANK, this review is aimed, primarily, at you. I suppose there must be some of you out thereWhat is quite difficult to fathom is that anyone with any REAL interest in Cinema could have managed to avoid seeing it for the 20+ years since its release! In a Perfect World, SHAWSHANK is the movie of choice. What a serendipitous confluence of diverse and inspired elements! It is the exception that proves the Murphy's Law rule. Just look at the IMDb breakdown analysis of the vote In every area of human activity, there is always that ""2%""! SHAWSHANK is no exception. Precisely 2% of voters rated SHAWSHANK 1 Star! I invite you to check! In our culture there is a recurring undercurrent nightmare scenario of long-term wrongful imprisonment. Make that a Universal scenario, perhaps, in ALL cultures. Not a SPOILER here, because this point is clearly established in the opening 5 minutes. SHAWSHANK is the ultimate Black/White ""BRO-mance"" Yet, uniquely, Morgan Freeman's character, ""Red"", is anything but the ""predestined to an untimely end"" sidekickThe entire film is literally narrated from Red's perspective. If anything, Red's ""Main-Man"" prison status gives him a bit of a dominant role in their relationship. But the interaction of their characters is clearly that of 2 equals, gradually morphing into one of lifelong best BUDS! I can't help but wonder if, while cast and crew were in the midst of making SHAWSHANK, any of them imagined the magnitude of the cinematic milestone they were involved in! Box Office results are rather jaw- dropping, but in a negative sense: Opening Weekend—A starkly paltry Position #144 among 1994 releases of just $750K U.S.! Overall 1994 Box Office, did not even make the Top 50! SHAWSHANK occupied a lackluster Spot #51, to be exact, with just over $28 Million taken in! My initial interest was piqued by a theatrical trailer, but I had to go by myselfMy wife, who is a rather avid movie goer, said""H-m-m-m-m, a prison drama?....What's the Title?"" After hearing it, she responded, ""The SHAW- What? No, ThanksI PASS!"" Well, needless to say, after a first viewing, my awe was complete and unmitigated, so I insisted on dragging her along just days later, for my second viewing. My wife became an instant SHAWSHANK believer. We both categorize this film in our lifetime top 5 favorites! Perhaps SHAWSHANK got off to such an inauspicious Box Office start for the same reasons that almost resulted in my wife not going to see it in 1994! I could literally write volumes on this movie, but, of course cannot here! A few more highlights: Interestingly, 7 Oscar Nominations, but ZER0 wins! Had the amazingly bad luck of having to compete with the mighty feel-good classic, FORREST GUMP, which steamrolled that year with 6 Oscars and #1 at the Box Office with $330 Million, about 12X SHAWSHANK's! Wonder what the Academy's members take on this would be today? Just look at the 7 categories where it was nominatedEach one is exquisitely superb! Not a single Golden StatuetteWOW! As far as Suspension of Disbelief is concerned, in the self-contained and totally insulated prison environment, it isn't much of a stretch to imagine an Old-Testament thumping warden anointing himself with almost god-like powers! Stranger things have happened, yes? In one odd twist, when one thinks of Illegal Immigration, Mexico, or Central America, to the USA invariably is the route that comes to mindnot the opposite, right!?!?!? Despite having seen SHAWSHANK at least 15 times, it never ceases to mesmerize me. My only real critique: I think Andy would have to have been a magician to do what he did at the end, at least, so seamlesslyCan't go into any more detail without treading into SPOILER territory, so you'll just have to figure it out for yourself! SHAWSHANK is truly a film for the ages! 10* STARS*....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA! Any comments, questions or observations, in English or Español, are most welcome!"
" I didn't think films could be this good....
",,"The Shawshank Redemption came out in 1994 and was an absolute flop but found its real audience in home video, peaking as the most rented video of 1995 in the USA. A wonderful film that takes you into the prison experience of Red(Morgan Freeman) and Andy (Tim Robbins). Andy being a banker convicted of murder and Red a murderer already serving time, this movie takes you to the limits of human endurance, where the human spirit eventually prevails. The TSR takes you on an emotional journey that you will remember for a long time, thanks to the superb crafting of the film and sincere performances by the cast. The score is deep and haunting, this film is for the ages and will permenantly have a place in my heart. To me it is the best film of the 90's and quite possibly one of the best of all time.The fact that this film is sitting at No.2 is a testament to just how many people love this film, many viewers seem to have an emotional bond with the film, and I don't blame them. I only wish that I could view the film for the first time again, and experience that redeeming feeling Andy and Red experienced at the end.Ignore the hype surrounding the film and judge it on your own experience, the last half hour are especially beautiful. Watch this if you already haven't, and enjoy the masterpiece that Frank Darabont has so gracefully given us the privilege of viewing. 10/10"
" NOT just a prison movie
",,"A film about a Stephen King story? Directed by Frank Darabont.  .  .  Who?  Starring Tim Robbins.  .  .  Wasn't he the guy from Howard the Duck?  I admit, only the sublime acting talents of Morgan Freeman took me along to see this movie.  Now the only questions I have to ask are:  Why didn't EVERYBODY go to see this movie?  and, Why didn't Morgan Freeman win the Oscar?  Tom Hanks is a fine actor but, he should never have beaten Morgan.  Once again a Stephen King short story translates to film better than his horror opus'.  Tim Robbins pulls out his finest performance to date, and, Mr Darabont take a bow.  Very rarely are you left with a large smile and warm heart at the end of a movie but, I could have danced as the camera slowly panned back from the beach.  .  .  Perfect."
" Highly Overrated But Still Good
",,"A good prison movie whose cult of fans has made it into something so much more than it is. Greatest movie ever made? Get real. It's not even the greatest prison movie ever made. Hell, it's not even the best movie released in 1994! It's predictable and borrows heavily from decades of prison movie clichés. It's also nowhere near as deep as its staunchest admirers would have you believe. Still, it's an entertaining movie. Nice direction from Frank Darabont. Morgan Freeman is the highlight with a solid supporting cast. Tim Robbins, however, is borderline ridiculous at times with his cartoonish facial expressions and silly ""stares-off-into-the-distance"" moments. He's so far beneath Freeman as an actor it's sad. With a normal movie like this, I would focus more on the positives. I did give it a 7, after all. Unfortunately, it is easily the most overrated movie of all time (on IMDb, for sure) and as such the balance of positive to negative is out of whack."
" Simply Perfect
",,"Like I did a few years back, you might be hesitating about watching this film. The title didn't appeal to me, and neither did the subject matter, so it was only by chance that I started to watch it.I can only say that the film was a revelation for me and has stayed with me ever since. There are so many dark and hopeless films out there which, whilst they leave an impression, leave the wrong one i.e that there is no hope in life. Watch this film and be uplifted and be encouraged by the message...that there is ALWAYS hope....in any situation.Please watch this film and the watch it again. It's a great answer to all the cynicism that is out there."
" A movie about an innocent clever man who learns to live within prison walls.
",,"This is Tim Robbins best performance ever. It is a compelling heart warming drama about an innocent man(Andy Dufresbe) who is sent to prison and learns to use his intelligence to make the best of prison life. He meets a mentor in Red(Morgan Freeman) and they build a friendship that is stronger than the walls that surround them. Andy steadies a relationship with the warden that keeps him in the good eyes of the prison. Andy is full of surprises and uses his resourcefulness to not only win the friendships of his fellow prisoners, but also of the prison guards. Both Andy and Red both hold on to their dream of one day enjoying their freedom. They turn their friendship and dreams of freedom into a bond that no prison could ever take away."
" Without a doubt one of the best movies of all time
",,"When I saw that the Shawshank Redemption was #1 on the top 250 movies of all time, I thought ""Yea, I could understand that"". I don't necessarily agree that it's absolutely the best, but it is so good that it makes sense that a forum of popular consensus for film rankings would rank it at the top.It is the story of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins and his time at Shawshank Prison. It is a perspective of what it is to be human and to have hope for the future even in the face of insurmountable adversity. It's funny, because I don't really think that any one particular thing stands out as spectacular. The performances are very good, but nothing really noteworthy. The characters all serve the story beautifully, but none of them really stand out from the others. Frank Darabont is great, the shots are exactly what they should be. Almost the entire film is shot at the prison, adding to the feeling of isolation and routine.And yet, we are captivated from the outset. Morgan Freeman could read a Sears catalogue and I'd pay to hear it, his narration breathes life into every scene that it's spoken over. The real beauty of this film is it's story, mostly about Andy and Red (Robbins and Freeman), but it's the way that each character contributes symbiotically to the development of the story that is the absolute mastery. Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" was the short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves as evidence that King is not just a master of horror, but a true literary genius. Sure, he doesn't use as many fifty cent words as histories other great masters, but does anyone tell as good a story? King always gives his writing such distinct atmosphere and energy that you can't help but get swept away. The Shawshank Redemption is no different. If there is a film by which other films should be judged, this is as good as it can get. Powerful, engaging, visceral, despairing, a masterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human. It's one of those journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel happy to be alive.An amazing story translated beautifully to the screen. A masterpiece, 10/10."
" An extraordinary and unforgettable film about a bank veep who is convicted of muders and sentenced to the toughest prison
",,"Superbly played film set in 1946 , a bright young New England banker is convicted of the slayings of his spouse and her lover and sentenced to life at a strict State Prison . Introspective and quite Andy (Tim Robbins) gradually befriends inmates and over the next 2 decades wins the trust of prisoners and wardens but in his heart he still yearns for freedom . There he forms a peculiar friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), the prison fixer , he experiences the brutality of prison life with a sadistic head guard (Clancy Brown), and is also mistreated and raped ; however , he adapts himself and offers financial advice to the guards and the selfish governor (Bob Gunton) , all in a shot 19 years. As two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding peace and redemption through acts of common help , friendship and decency . But when the proof of Andy's innocence is ripped away by those who need his services ,we learn that all is not quite what it seems at this State Penitentary , provoking a few susprises in the last two reels .
This is a very good and serious prison movie with thrills , emotion , exciting scenes , colour-blind relationships , hardnut camaraderie , gang opression , and violent disavowal of any homosexual implications . Prison buffs will find a lot of incidents to relish and the great spiritual resolution takes some swallowing and unexpected surprises . Adapted from the novella ¨Rita Hayworth and Shawshank redemption¨ ; the twist here is the upright starring is exceptionally bright , as his ability with accountancy leads to his handling the finances of everyone , from the humblest guard to the prison boss . Wonderful spectacle in watching time-passer while changing the bombshell actresses of the history : Rita Hayworth , Marilyn Monroe , Raquel Welch . US prison films have been making solid fares for more than sixty years and apart from slowness of pace in the second half , this one is well up to prison standards . This Frank Darabont's theatrical debut turns out to be a throwback rendition to the kind of literate , thought-provoking prison drama Hollywood used to make , such as : I am a fugitive from a chain gang , Birdman of Alcatraz and Escape from Alcatraz .Tim Robbins plays magnificently Andy , an inmate finding solace and eventual redemption , Tim provides his usual talent for playing ambiguous roles , as his notable skills are put to good use. Along with Robbins' best screen acting there are various Oscar-worthy supporting characters with special mention for Morgan Freeman as the good fixer who brings his ordinary grace to what could have been a thankless role , the veteran James Withmore as the crow-keeping librarian , the sympathetic newcomer inmate Gil Bellows ,William Sadler , Mark Rolston and the ruthless guardian Clancy Brown and , of course , the egoistic and nasty governor excellently played by Bob Gunton .It contains a colorful and evocative cinematography by Roger Deakins . And an enjoyable and really feeling musical score by Thomas Newman . In his engrossing direction debut ,Darabont avoids boring by fleeing most prison movie cliches . It results to be a pleasure of discovering a first-time filmmaker with evident respect for the intelligence of his audience , giving sensitive scenes , and brave enough to let roles details accumulate without recourse the excessively maudlin and over-sentimentality. It is a true masterpiece , being marvelously acted and perfectly paced."
" Richly human, uplifting
",,"Deservedly ranked at the top of IMDb's all-time best 250 films ever.The casting is superb: Morgan Freeman is ""Red,"" a wise observer of people and an entrepreneur inmate who's made ""connections"" so he can get contraband to other inmates for a price; he's under a life sentence for murder. Tim Robbins is ""Andy,"" a smart banker and accounting whiz who was sentenced to 2 life terms for killing his wife and her lover (which he--like most other inmates, say they're not guilty of). And Bob Gunton is ""Warden Norton"" who, when we first meet him, is touting the virtues of Bible reading and strict discipline. While, fortunately, I've had no first hand experience, ""Shawshank"" certainly gives the feel of authenticity of prison life and its society.A long movie, most of it takes place inside a semi-corrupt state penitentiary in the late 1940s. ""Red,"" in talking his thoughts out loud to himself, becomes our narrator for many developments. As the story unfolds, increasingly we come to see Andy as a person with strong personal values which he upholds in the most difficult situations. And in Andy's work for Warden Norton, we also increasingly find the warden as morally his opposite: selfish and fundamentally lacking decent moral character--all show and appearance and with no integrity, substance.In Roger Ebert's first review (of his two) of this movie, he said: ""....the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything....the word redemption is in the title for a reason...."" Most viewers will agree."
" the Shawshank redemption is a world class film
",,"the Shawshank redemption should be played throughout the world in all schools to teach people the hard life of prison but the bond between friends and the idea of hope. Morgan freeman is a second to none actor he lays the role perfectly and i could not think what the film would be like without him. all the other actors perform perfectly. this movie is a movie of inspiration and one of which will get people through harsh times. this film always restores my faith in mankind i simply love it. I first saw this film sitting on my brothers desk and i was intrigued by the idea of a film set in prison where hope and other morale values were the storyline instead of violence and havoc, this is a amazing film which brings pride to the actors and crew who produced it. the setting of the movie is one of perfection the Gothic grounds and the stunning facilities astound me i'am finding it hard to put in to words how much this film means to me i would say it is one of the greatest film's ever made in my time and i love it."
" What a movie!!!
",,"I totally adored the concept of hope in this film. I love how the director portrays the Shawshank tyrants as corrupt murderers, that's pretty much what they are and serve as the grounds for the escape of Andy. Now Morgan Freeman's got talent, I love that guy he may not be the greatest out there but he is a force to be reckoned with on the set. I loved how he gave the story flavor with his descriptions of characters and perceptions of how life was in lonely jail cells of Shawshank. You know there's a lot more to say about this movie, it's too good too be true. Especially the ending which by the way brought tears to eyes, the most moving scene!!! Overall it was superb and all thanks to Stephen King for putting this in the form of alphabets in the first place. I'm starting to regret not reading any of his novels. And kudos to the director for even coming up with such an idea for a movie."
" An amazing tale of hope and patience
",,"When i rented the movie, i was doubtful, whether to rent it or not. Then i started watching it. From the very 1st moment i was kinda sure, it wud be worthy watching this; and worthy it was. The fascinating performance of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, the direction, and everything puts you in the place of the actors, making you feel the way they felt. This movie doesn't have any dirty romance or impossible actions, rather, it focuses on a greater philosophy - Hope to live when there is no hope, survival -- This is one movie, that will leave you talking about it even many days after watching. I won't say anymore, the rest is up-to you to find out when you see the movie"
" A favourite film
",,"When i watched this film i thought now whats this going to be like? After watching it i thought it was a brilliant film,fantastically acted with greats like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton. Very realistic and definitely one of my absolute favourites of all time. At the end it made me cry and thought about life. Every time i watch it the film brings a tear to my eye. Fantastic film and worth watching,it's really realistic film and another one of stephen king's great stories, a story of hope and many people who have watched will say the same thing - if you haven't seen this film already then watch it, it is brilliant, just brilliant!!be prepared to be moved, it's such a breathtaking journey for the whole two hours. A truly lovely magical film, my favourite of all time fantastic"
" When There is Life, There is Hope; When There is Hope, There is Life
",,"Like many of the reviewers, I hate prison movies with all the clichés and stereotypes of innocent prisoners, nasty guards, and evil wardens; and upon first viewing, many years ago, I especially disliked being forced by this film to feel sympathy and empathy with murderers, rapists and the like.Shawshank has somehow transcended the test of time; and I believe that it has endured, not because of the great performances (which don't seem to be acting at all, but real), not because of the simple, but multi-level, story line with its twists and turns, not because of its magnificent photography, not because of its score, and not because of any individual element that went into the making of this film. (Hence, the lack of academy awards.) However, when all those elements are combined, Shawshank becomes one of those masterpieces which is greater than the sum of its parts...and this film is so much greater that in the desperation of its characters, it invokes a multitude of good emotions in the viewer...that there is divine, poetic justice and hope in this hell of a world.Shawshank has become my favorite film of all time, but it took a while. ""When your're feeling down and out, watch Shawshank!"" Raising my vote from 8/10 to 10/10 (however subjective that vote may be.)"
" One of the greatest movies of all time
",,"The first time I saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"" I was only 12. At the time I was amazed at how a movie could present so much emotion. As I have grown, my taste in movies has also. Still, I rank ""Shawshank"" as my favorite film, the one that I could watch every day for the rest of my life. If you have not seen this film, I pity you. Do not just rent it at your local Blockbuster. I implore you step away from your computer, go out to the nearest store, and buy this movie. Not only do Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give performances that will make you question your humanity, but you will most definitely learn something that will benefit you as a person. So, if you are yet to see this film, you must (in the words of Andy), ""Get busy livin', or get busy dyin'."""
" Very Cool!!!
",,"Since I bought (a lot of years ago) a videotape with two Stephen King's short films, one of them ""The Woman In The Room"", directed by Frank Darabont, I had the strange sensation that this guy could very well become one of the good directors in the filming industry... and here we are, with another King's story he managed to do one of the best films in this decade (90's), of course, with the help of nonetheless but mr. Freeman and mr. Robbins, who could have spoiled it?"
" Well Worth A Read.
",,"I enjoyed reading Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth And Shawshank Redemption"" from the book ""Different Seasons"" more than watching the movie. However, it's still one of my favourite movies of all time.It has very few peers, and has to be seen. It is Awesome."
" The greatest movie ever made and to be made
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is a story of life itself. It is not about a person in prison, it is about the soul and the battle it accepts and carries on to deserve the life it has been given by God. I watched the movie for the first time some months ago. That evening I was about to go out with some friends but out meeting was canceled and I had to stay home. Being unhappy about that, I started watching the movie on the TV just by chance, not knowing about its existence before that at all. At first I was skeptic, I admit that. But oh God, at the end of it I was screaming and jumping in my room at 1 AM! It gave me so much emotions and so much hope, I had never felt before that. I could hardly believe that a movie could make me feel that way - so excited, so happy about my life, leaving me believing so much in my own self. It is a great story of what the strength of your thoughts can make you do. In The Shawshank Redemption desire does not make you weak, just the opposite - gives you wings to fly away from fear, fly closer and closer to freedom. Morgan Freeman's voice is just another advantage that makes the movie even more impressive. Tim Robbins' act is just beyond perfection! I bought the DVD this summer and every time I feel weak or just bad about something, I watch the movie. It has become my personal shrink, making me feel strong enough anytime I watch it. Can never imagine a better movie made anywhere in the world even after 1000 years!"
" A bit overrated, but still an amazing film
",,"It's times like these that almost tempt me to grab Jigsaw off the shelf. It's been almost a month since I saw a film that was flatout bad; the worst review I've given in weeks was a 6/10 to Flightplan. This film obviously didn't break my streak.I went into it knowing next to nothing, only that IMDb has it ranked as the second best movie of all time, that it was based on a story by Stephen King, and that it took place in a prison. Needless to say, it blew me away. I wont say a thing about the plot, just so that others who've yet to see this film have a chance at the same experience as me. I will say this though: It has some of the most subtle and unexpected twists you will ever see. One in particular stands out above the rest.Not much can be said about the actors that hasn't been said. Morgan Freeman gives one of the best performances of his career, and even though I've only seen 2 or 3 other Tim Robbins movies, I'm sure the same can be said for him.Though I don't agree with the multitudes of people that call this the best movie ever made, it was still a very good, very well made, very entertaining and almost heartbreaking film.9/10"
" Best of all time!!!
",,This is the best movie I have ever seen. In a way I feel I am in a prison of life myself. Restricted to doing certain things. Sometimes I get frustrated and feel as I should runaway to some place where I could feel free. I hope and dream for it sometime. This movie just reminds me of my feelings so much. I love Andy Dufresne most in this movie. Although critics say Tim Robbins didn't do enough to express the character but my personal opinion is that he was made for this role.I can go on and say more but I said the most important thing which I feel whenever I watch it.I am glad to visit IMDb. I never heard of it before. Some 7 years ago I saw it at no.2 in the rankings and decided to watch it immediately. Only other movie which even comes close to this is Citizen Kane. But that is about past and this one is about hope and freedom.I give it 11/10.
" Enthralling, fantastic, intriguing, truly remarkable!
",,"Shawshank Redemption is without doubt one of the best films ever made, and definitely the best film of 1994. Yes, it is better than Lion King, and I really like that too. It is not only enthralling but powerful and moving too. I will confess that I didn't understand it when I first saw it as a lot happens in the film, and I have now seen it three times. I seriously hope, that those who ignored the film when it was first released now recognise it as a great film, as it really is. The dialogue was extremely well-written, with lines that really stick in your mind. The cinematography and music are both gorgeous, and the prison itself is like a character that dominates the film. In the script, there are some true elements of Stephen King Now I admit I am not a huge king fan, and usually don't like coarse language in books. But in his books like It, which is very good, I have accepted the language represents brutality and rebellion, shown perfectly in the film with the battle of acceptance I suppose between the inmates and the superiors(like the scene with the warden yelling coarse language at the new inmates lined up in a row at the beginning.)The acting was exceptional. I am not hugely familiar with Tim Robbins, but he did a great job in a very demanding role. The best performance however, comes from Morgan Freeman as Red, who was seriously robbed of that Oscar, that he lost to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump. Freeman reminds me very strongly, or his style of acting does, remind me of that of Sean Connery, suave yet very charismatic. Acting isn't just about your vocal range, it's about depth, which was what Freeman certainly had. In short, Freeman was brilliant in what could be his best performance. The scene where the inmates are listening to the Mozart aria over the speakers was a beautiful profound moment, and I actually cried in Brook's death scene. Very rarely do King adaptations translate-to screen well, because of the large scale of the author's books, with the exception of this and the Shining. Some like It and Dreamcatcher are genuinely memorable but have a number of flaws that prevent them from being classed as outstanding. And some, like Thinner and Tommyknockers that border on unwatchable. In conclusion Shawshank is a brilliant film, that is worthy of the credit it has been denied for so-long. 10/10 of course. Bethany Cox."
" A melodramatic, motherf***ing masterpiece
",,"In this review I'm not going to give a plot synopsis of this film because I'm sure everybody else who has commented on it has. However, I will express the positive effect it can have on the viewer if they let it.The acting is uncommonly magnificent. Morgan Freeman delivers the greatest performance of his brilliant career as the seasoned life-serving prisoner Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, Tim Robbins holds his own against Freeman as Andy, the central character, James Whitmore's portrayal of the institutionalized Brooks provides the backbone of the story, Bob Gunton is wonderful as the corrupt Warden Norton, and Clancy Brown's commanding performance as Captain Hadley, the sadistic head prison guard, almost makes him steal the show from Freeman.Frank Darabont's restrained direction of the delicate story is critical for the film to not become sentimental or clichéd, and his beautiful adaptation of the Stephen King story on which the movie is based is a real breath of fresh air. On account of Darabont, the film shows that special effects are not needed to tell a great story in film. As a 17-year-old male, I love special effects movies as much as the next person, but they get boring after a while. Plus many people forget that there was a time in cinema when the blockbuster didn't exist, when they made movies that just told great stories and gave the audience a chance to be uplifted by those stories without the creators having to resort to special effects. I applaud you for having the guts to make a non-commercial film that reminds people of that in this day and age, Mr. Darabont.SPOILER ALERT! As with all truly great films, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is full of scenes that have become entrenched in the public's collective consciousness. There's the scene where Andy plays the opera record over the loudspeaker for all the inmates in the prison, Captain Hadley bashing ""Fat @$$"" to death for crying during his first night in prison (a very powerful scene), Red giving his ""Rehabilitated?"" speech to the board of parole officials, the Warden getting his final judgement, and of course, Andy crawling to freedom through what Red in his narration calls ""500 yards of s**t-smelling foulness I can't even imagine,"", the scene which for me is perhaps the greatest movie scene of the '90s.END OF SPOILERS! I thoroughly recommend this cinematic masterpiece, which has earned its place in my humble top ten films of all time list, to anybody. Whatever gender, age, religion, nationality etc. you are and whatever language you speak, I guarantee it will change your life, or perhaps even save it. Movies like 'The Shawshank Redemption' only come along once every decade, if that. Unforgettable.10/10."
" This Movie Saved My Life.
",spoiler,"I have been a fan of this movie for a long time.It seems that ever time my life hits a downward spiral, I can always seem to pop this movie in, and come up with a solution to my pending problem. It somehow gives Me sense of peace and inner strength.So, It wasn't all that strange for me to pop it in when I was going through a rough patch in my marriage. I found myself identifying with many of the characters in this movie.Many of them are trapped in a world of regret and mourning, due to a mistake that had been made early on in their lives. This film gave me the strength to escape from my world of misery. And now I am able to say I, Like Andy broke out of my own personal Shawshank.My Ex isn't too happy about the divorce. But life is much better now. And I feel saved from a life of unhappiness, Due to a mistake of a marriage to early in life.Thank You Frank Durabont.Your film saved my life."
" One of the best movies I have ever seen
",,"This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. I first read the book, and I didn't liked it that much, but then I saw the movie. And that's a things that's never happened to me before, the movie was better than the book. It's the other way normally. But in this case, the movie is so much better, I like the end more than in the book. Watch the movie, it is great."
" Why it is ranked so highly.
",,"Over the years many IMDb users have wondered why ""The Shawshank Redemption"" was ranked so high, and many ""wished"" that in time it would sink to a lower, more appropriate slot. Many analyses missed the mark. Following is the real reason it is ranked so high, and why it will never sink much, if any. And I hope it never does.This film deals with several ""hot"" buttons in us. A cheating spouse. A husband wrongly convicted and sent to prison. Corrupt law enforcement. A prison where inmates get maimed or killed. A smart inmate who plots a brilliant escape. The corrupt warden getting his just reward. Two friends being re-united with a good life ahead of them. Combined with a good script and good cinematography. What's not to like about this story?I have seen this movie a number of times. Each time I get something new out of it that I either didn't see before, or had not made a mental connection to. I recently (year 2014) upgraded my personal copy from DVD to Blu-Ray and both the picture and sound are better. This film continues to spark the occasional argument of whether it really should be rated on IMDb as the top film of all time. I don't know exactly where ""Shawshank Redemption"" should rank on the all-time list. That is akin to comparing home run hitters or golfers from different centuries. The games are quite different, as is true in cinema. I gave this film a ""10"", and on my list it is in one of the best movies of all time, along with a number of others. At the same time, I recognize that everyone else has a different opinion. I don't really see any value in trying to decide a rank order for all time. Each film should be appreciated for what it has to offer, no more, and no less."
" Overrated and overthought
",spoiler,"The movie is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen, but to be honest, the movie is also greatly overrated in many ways. I believe that the reason the movie is so popular is because of the huge wave of popularity towards voting it up. As the movie portrays the continuous struggle for the main character, Andy Dufresne, you are in suspense, and locked by the question whether he did it or not. And even though he keeps doing good and honorable thing for the guards and his fellow inmates. There was in my experience not a moment before he escaped where you are absolutely certain that he did not do it. This is the thing that captivates a lot of people i think, and i follow this aspect, and i understand it. But even though this movie, in my opinion does not have any flaws, it is still not perfect, and i do not think that it is the best, not flawed feature film ever made."
" prison escape

Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film.

" An astonishing tale of endurance, courage, life, and perspective..
",,"At the time of writing this comment, IMDb ranks the Shawshank Redemption as No. 2 in top 250 best movies of all time. Let me tell you that this is no exaggeration and no small feat given IMDb's strict rating criteria. Shawshank is indeed, up there amongst the best, and if you haven't seen it yet, you should make it a point to watch it, at least once sometime in your life. For it is an astonishing tale, of endurance, courage, life, and perspective, combined with a stunning score that flows so closely with the highs and lows of emotion that it could make grown men cry. No words can explain how good Shawshank really is, but let the sheer volume of good user reviews made by devotees in this website be proof enough of its greatness."
" one of my absolute favorites!
",,"This is definitely one of my favorite movies -- it makes me cry and laugh and ache inside all at once.  Tim Robbins, you make my days a little brighter -- thank you!"
" The best movie ever?
",,"Before watching Shawshank Redemption for the first time, I really didn't think much of it. I thought it had probably wrongfully earned the #1 spot here on IMDb, and couldn't be better than The Godfather for example. A movie that was ""cool"" to like, if you will. I could imagine fashion conscious movie-hipsters discussing movies over their glasses of Napa Valley Chardonnay, arguing who liked Shawshank Redemption the most, and which movie by Ingmar Bergman had the strongest metaphorical messages. You get the idea.I'm sure everything I have to say about the way the movie has been made has been said better in one of the other comments. That said, the reason I'm posting this review is because Shawshank Redemption isn't only a hardcore movie freak's wet dream. While it's brilliantly written, has some of the most fluent acting I have seen and shows the fantastic directing skills of Frank Darabont, you really don't have to be an expert of film theory to appreciate it. It appeals to so many different groups of people, and so many different human feelings at the same time. The ""weaknesses"" it had as it came out (the idea of a jail movie not being compatible with the female population, and the idea of a movie about lifelong friendship between two men not being compatible with the male population) is actually the reason Shawshank Redemption is loved by nearly all: It offers something for everyone.In my opinion rating something 10/10 is a bit too absolute for anything, but since this is probably the best movie I remember seeing, and my first 10/10, I think I'll let it slide this time."
" Blatantly Simple, yet Utterly Beautiful
",spoiler,"To tell the truth, I am speechless. I am a young movie fanatic, in fact, this film came out the same year I was born, and therefore I am more used to films incredible special effects, edge-of-your-seat action, et cetera. This film has none of that, and yet, it appeals so closely to me. The way Frank Darabont uses the narration of Red to drive on the story, the beauty of the soundtrack used (note the harmonica used just before Red's finding of the letter close to the end). The entire film, from beginning to end, from actions to sound, is a beacon of hope, judgement, and redemption. The cast is perfect, Morgan Freeman(Red) actually brings about a refreshing feel to the tale, and that is exactly what the movie is, what a movie should be. Highly recommended for every viewer, no matter your taste(or age- !judgement excludes use of language or violence!). I can't say it deserved its nO.1 position, i can't say any movie does, but if any movie should, this one might as well be it. *********"
" Stephen King's prison tale with a happy ending...
",,"THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a kind of morality tale that is definitely one of Stephen King's more restrained kind of stories, dealing mostly with a character study of two individuals sharing imprisonment and the consequences that await them when the tale ends.TIM ROBBINS is a man wrongly convicted of murder and serving a long prison term while MORGAN FREEMAN (who plays the narrator with great dignity) describes himself as ""the only guilty man in Shawshank."" The hardships of prison life are captured in brief scenes that make the viewer wish that Robbins will find a way of escape. Along the way, he is gang raped by prisoners and treated harshly by a brutal warden and some of his spirit seems to vanish. But Robbins is quietly effective as a prisoner who makes a good adjustment when he takes charge of the prison library and sees to it that there's a wider selection of books than the kind of potboilers that King is noted for writing. A touch of irony here, no? The closing scenes are a bit of a stretch and a reminder of just who wrote this prison tale--but still, they make an impact because of all that happens before.It's a bittersweet story, a sort of horrific fairy-tale of what might have happened, but the viewer will be caught up in the story because of the tremendously skillful story-telling magic of Stephen King and director Frank Darabont who also wrote the screenplay."
" If other people would rave about it less, I'd rave about it more
",,"The redeeming feature of this film is that it was made in innocence. Darabont had no idea he was making anything profound.  And he wasn't.  This is a film about a prisoner who ... well, I can't give away the plot, for it's much better to come to the screen in ignorance; but anyone who thinks that this is a story about how Andy `finds out the truth about himself', or is in any way `redeemed', is grasping at straws.  These elements play so little role in the overall structure that we might as well ignore them.I have a theory: so many people have told Darabont that `The Shawshank Redemption' was a profound life-changing experience that he believed them, and then SET OUT to make another `profound, life changing experience' with `The Green Mile', with predictably ghastly results.  I haven't seen `The Green Mile' yet, so I can't be sure.Don't get me wrong.  A great movie needn't be profound, and the film which I think is the best ever made isn't profound, either - it contains no comment at all on the Nature of Human Existence or anything of that kind.  Still, `The Shawshank Redemption' isn't even great.  It's a very good story very well told.  Lucky we get such nice photography, rather than having to put up with Stephen King's prose every step of the way ...  Also, Tim Robbins has the lead role.  (Lucky, again, that it wasn't Tom Hanks - now THERE'S a frightening thought.)  Nobody can do the bewildered but intelligent innocent so well as he can.  Fans make such extravagant claims about this movie, but I don't think it makes such extravagant claims about itself, which is why it works so well."
" The BEST movie ever made.
",,"Emotion, hope and justice all blend perfectly in this film. Quite simply, no other film comes close to this one in regards to screenplay, casting and plot development. No spoilers here - just a comment on a movie that can still move you to tears even after multiple viewings. Morgan Freeman delivers the performance of a lifetime. Everything else comes together in perfect harmony. This movie came out the same year as Forrest Gump which won the Oscar for best picture - Forrest Gump is a great picture but this one really deserved the ""cake"". Tim Robbins is AMAZING as Andy, and he supported brilliantly by a cast that one could only hope to see assembled again. This is one of those rare occasions where the movie actually surpasses the book for drama, suspense and flow. If you haven't seen this film, please do yourself the favour and watch it. I know you will not be disappointed!""Get busy livin'"""
" Tedious, overlong, with ""hope"" being the second word spoken in just about every sentence... who cares?
",,"I simply fail to understand how this film is so popular... it's quite simply beyond me. The only way I can explain it is that all the fans of King's short story found it very true to the spirit of the book, and voted 10 for that. I really could not find anything worth my time in this film, and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the end, one or two good lines of dialog and the acting, there's really nothing in the whole film worth watching it for. It's about hope... and the director won't let us forget it, so it's repeated until the audience mumbles it in our sleep. It's like this short, one-note story was written, and the author just didn't want to end it... so he kept writing... and writing... until someone had the sense to break down the door and wrestle the pen from him yelling ""for the love of all that is holy, stop writing!"" And I thank that faceless man for doing that, because it is undoubtedly the only reason the film was 142 minutes long, and not 284, or, dare I say it, 568. The film simply drones on and on, scene after scene, containing nothing remotely interesting(but with excellent acting, mind you). There's nothing good about this film except for the acting. Just about all of it is great. I can't really think of anything else to say... I guess my dislike for the film stems from my hatred of King's writing. I suppose it is possible for someone who is neutral on his works to enjoy this film. I recommend this to fans of Stephen King, the actors and possibly Frank Darabont. If you're not a fan of any of these people, I doubt you'd find this enjoyable. 5/10"

" A moving masterpiece.
",spoiler,"From the summary above which you will have seen, i stated the film to be a moving masterpiece. Right from the word go i was drawn into the films twisting emotional plot. It caught my attention that Frank Darabont has placed a small amount of aspects into the film that get the audience emotionally involved in which we base ourselves into simply putting our feet in one of the convicts shoes. Tt especially caught my eyes with the montage of shots in which the character Brooks (James Whitmore) takes his own life, the non-diagetic sound adding to the other element of suspense of the scene and the devastation of the tragic loss of the character in which we have been following through the course of the film. The cinematography throughout the film was basic and what i would term as standard, seen before basic film camera-work. If this was better it would have highly improved the films overall watch. throughout the course of the film we see Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) supposedly framed for the murder of his wife and her lover. We see how he progresses through the twenty years he spends at Shawshank Prison. We see Robbins act brilliantly as the role of a nimble, lost and lonely convict turn into a reliant of the Head Warden. This all becomes of the fact that in Dufresne's previous life he was a city banker, which is where he gets the nickname of 'wife murdering banker' around the dim lit prison. Morgan Freeman also shows that he is one of the worlds leading role- modelling actors as he pulls of another supreme unique perform. The way he acts during the duration of the film is entirely versatile proving the Freeman is an exceptional actor and performs single handed an outstanding performance.The plot consists of many twists and turns with both leading characters getting into difficult situation and how they overcome them, or not.The final half an hour of the film is soul touching and what i would term as an emotional rollacoaster with a large twist at the end. As suspense builds it creates a sensational climax tagging the film a must watch!I generally don't watch films more than once or twice but this is a different story. It still amazes me to this day and still gets me moving every time, it also influences me a lot.If you haven't watched this i highly recommend you do so!Joe Ferrari"
" Hope is a Good Thing. Maybe the Best of Things. And No Good Thing Ever Dies.
",,"Out of the three genre-defining classics released in 1994, The Shawshank Redemption was the one that ended up bearing the maximum brunt. First commercially by failing to recover its budget for it debuted in theatres together with one of cinema's greatest watershed events; Pulp Fiction. And then at Academy Awards where it was nominated for seven Oscars yet failed to win any, thanks to the sweeping show by the critics' darling, Forrest Gump.But life ever since has been very kind to this film, and both critics & viewers have embraced its uplifting story of hope & friendship with remarkable amount of respect, love & kindness. Today, The Shawshank Redemption enjoys a position that's arguably even higher than the two classics which eclipsed it back in 1994 and while it was discarded at its time of release, it is now rightly & universally acknowledged as one of the greatest films of all time.The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife & her illicit lover and is ultimately sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison where his coping with the brutal hardships of confined life slowly earns him the respect of his fellow inmates & prison staff, including that of ""Red"" in whom Andy finds a trusted ally. The remainder of the film explores their friendship over the next two decades.Written & directed by Frank Darabont, this prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship & redemption that'll manage to connect deeply with most of us in one way or another plus it also marks Darabont's directional debut and he couldn't have asked for a better start. All this film has is men in either prison or police uniforms talking to one another over the course of its runtime and yet it never looked dull or felt like dragging at any given moment.Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison and provides considerable depth & realism to the era this film is set in. Every moment of despair has a shadowy appearance while moments of hope gleam with light. Editing is spectacular too as the gradual progression of Andy's life, his friendship with Red, and his determination to not give in to the four walls containing him is effectively unfolded. And Thomas Newman's score beautifully blends with the film's tone & characters' lives, and is emotionally fulfilling.Coming to the performances, Tim Robbins delivers a swashbuckling performance as Andy Dufresne, the banker wrongfully convicted for the crime he didn't commit. And if Robbins is at his best, then Morgan Freeman is even better as Red, Andy's friend who is also serving a life sentence & is notorious amongst the inmates for he can smuggle goods into the prison. Freeman also narrates the story to us at which he does an even better job. His work is grounded & can go easily unnoticed, but the character of Red is the soul of this story.There is a reason why this film still connects with so many people & why many of them have latched on to it. There is a reason why even after two decades, its legacy keeps flourishing & viewers keep returning to it despite its low entertainment value. One major reason is that even though The Shawshank Redemption is a prison drama, its story of imprisonment goes far beyond the bricks & steel rods of a jailhouse. The entire picture is a reflection of our own imprisonment in the institutions of our daily lives; institutions like work, family, society etc & living up to the expectations of each one of them.On an overall scale, The Shawshank Redemption stresses that based on the outlook of life, there are only two types of people: one who can be free even in prison while others who find themselves imprisoned even in freedom. The message it is trying to resonate is clear: Fear can hold you prisoner, Hope can set you free. And if we all give ourselves some hope, there is nothing we can't survive. Yes, it all seems preachy n everything, but then if there's ever been a motion picture that has earned this sort of right, it's The Shawshank Redemption. Strongly recommended."
" Sublimely powerful.
",,"It deserves ten stars. Its beauty lies in its slow pace and genteel wit, although some may not have the patience for the slowness. But the whole premise of life inside a prison cell makes better sense when told in a calm, emotion-building, pace such as this. Otherwise, one would never get to know Tim Robbins's quiet accountant (and what makes him appear alternately shy, snobbish, and suicidal all at the same time); or Morgan Freeman's genial-but-cynical lifer- not to mention how he's ""a man who knows how to get things."" I love what the film doesn't do: it doesn't make an issue of its two leads being different races (although one could claim that makes their friendship all the more marvelous), it doesn't pull any sensational, far-out, action punches (as films with an all-male cast often do), and it doesn't freeze its characters into types. Everyone is real and everyone is flawed- from James Whitmore's bird loving veteran to Bob Gunton's pretentious, icy, warden. But the finish (which really starts around the film's last twenty minutes) is one of the most powerful and moving things ever committed to film. Get it in either format."
" Excellent Movie, But Not ""Greatest of All Time.""
",spoiler,"I finally watched The Shawshank Redemption and I agree that it is an excellent film. The pacing, directing, and storyline, holds interest throughout, along with a superb supporting cast, and a very moving ending.The main character is Andy played by Tim Robbins who is imprisoned for the murder of his wife. Later on in the movie, the evidence comes out that he is truly innocent. However The Shawshank Redemption sends a powerful message that it doesn't matter whether you are innocent or not inside Shawshank penitentiary. This is because the prison is run by a sadistic and corrupt staff. In this facility, you must use all of the intellect you can, both book smarts, and street smarts to not only stay alive, but prevent yourself from going insane within the system.Andy befriends ""Red,"" a fellow inmate, played by Morgan Freeman in another great performance. He teaches Andy street smarts of survival within Shawshank's hell-hole. Andy, an experienced banker with a master ability for finance and book learning, manipulates the prison officials to get funds to set up a ""basic skills"" learning facility within the prison's library. Red helps him organize this, and HOW Andy sets up the funding is really an amazing part of the movie. Another inmate is the head librarian, known as ""Brooks,"" who delivers many amazing scenes in the movie.What is special about The Shawshank redemption is how the characters, especially Andy and Red, are able to use their inner abilities to rise above the conditions of the prison and the people who run it. There are some disturbing and violent images that show the harsh realities of prison life, such as fighting, and often getting beaten by the staff or punished for very small offenses and a lot of times for no reason at all. The Shawshank Redemption shows the abuse of power by prison authorities and how the inmates have to have the courage to rise above this abuse, because they need to do this, in order to keep living. They learn that failure to get this courage and survival skills from other inmates will destroy them. A great quote in this film is. ""you can get busy living, or you can get busy dying."" Another interesting experience is how Red often wonders how at his advancing age he will be able to survive outside the prison if and when the parole board lets him go. An underlining message is that whether you ""get busy living or dying"" you become so accustomed to life in a controlling environment that the outside world, and the struggles, to reach it, to become physically and mentally ""free"" are an enormous challenge requiring great perseverance and the ultimate in determination.As good as this movie is, I was looking for that spark of magic that would put it at and over the top of all time classic films. However, I think that there are some outstanding prison movies that are just as good if not better than The Shawshank Redemption. Watch the Sean Penn Movie, ""Bad Boys"" for an outstanding portrayal inside and outside a juvenile prison. (Interestingly, Clancy Brown, who plays the bad officer in ""Shawshank,"" is just as good as a prison bully in ""Bad Boys."") Another great movie is ""Midnight Express"" which is (although loosely) based on the real story of Billy Hayes who was arrested in Turkey for trying to smuggle hashish back to the USA in 1970. This is another amazing survival prison picture with an unforgettable musical score and some chilling moments.I see The Shawshank Redemption equal to, but no better than ""Midnight Express"" or ""Bad Boys."" This is NOT a criticism of a fine movie! I am only putting The Shawshank Redemption in strikingly similar prison survival pictures that don't get the same credit that this movie does. Call this movie the greatest ever, and you have to do the same for ""Midnight Express"" or ""Bad Boys."" All three films have the same emotional impact. Another under rated movie that you should see is ""An Innocent Man,"" which is also similar to The Shawshank Redemption but is considered only above average.The Shawshank Redemption is a great film for its time. But because of similarities to other similar prison pictures, I can't classify it as great for all time"
" A Bit Over-Rated Perhaps, But Still A Good Movie With Great Performances From Freeman and Robbins
",spoiler,"Deliberately (some might even say slowly in places) paced, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" alternates between offering a grittily realistic portrayal of life in prison and flights of fancy that make the story too unbelievable to really be accepted. There is an interesting subplot (which doesn't take up much of the movie but which does make the viewer ponder) about the difficulties of adjusting to life in the real world after extended periods of incarceration. The performances from the two leads are excellent. Morgan Freeman puts on his usual outstanding performance as ""Red"" - the wise old con through whose eyes the story is told, and Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresnce, a young banker wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover who has to adjust to the nightmare of prison life. Among the supporting cast I was impressed with Bob Gunton as the Bible-spouting but corrupt Warden Norton, who uses Andy's financial expertise to enrich himself, and James Whitmore as Brooks, imprisoned for fifty years and terrified when he is finally granted parole and who, unable to adjust to life on the outside, yearns only to be back in the only home he ever knew - prison. It's an interesting twist - experience also by Red later on in the movie - that freedom can seem to be like a prison for those so accustomed to the regimentation of life in an institution.While the movie is impressive and engrossing all the way through, though, there are some weaknesses to the story that bothered me a bit. (There are some spoilers ahead.)I found it difficult to imagine prison guards from all over the State of Maine bringing their tax returns to Andy. It just didn't seem to me like something that would have happened. It also struck me as unlikely that a letter-writing campaign from one solitary prisoner (even one that lasted six years, one letter a week) would have convinced the State to fund the improvements Andy got for the prison library. I would rather expect that after a while the letters would simply start to be discarded. Andy's escape also bothered me. It was too ""easy"" - even though it took twenty years. And how did he keep that suit so spotless and unwrinkled while crawling through that dirty sewer? Mind you, the moments leading up to the discovery of his escape were among the most dramatic in the movie. The very end of the story was also clearly telegraphed some time before.Frankly speaking, I think ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a bit over-rated here at IMDb, being ranked the second best movie of all time, but this is still a very, very good movie, and an excellent portrayal (through Andy) of the survival of the human spirit in even the toughest times. Personally, I give it a 7/10."
" The Shawshank Redemption
",spoiler,"A friend of mine listed ""The Shawshank Redemption"" as one her all time favorite movies and that brought on my curiosity what Shawshank Redemption was, I even thought it was a typo. The next day I went out and brought home the 10 years anniversary DVD without knowing I was going to spend the most worthwhile 2 and a half hours of my life in front of the TV (a melodrama doesn't kill, right?)I don't know how to write a good movie review so I guess telling you what I feel about it may do better. I remembered crying a few times, being astounded by the plot twist for a moment or two and ending up sitting alone, inert and all, just because of the once-in-a-lifetime beauty of Shawshank. Just recall the scene in which Andy locked himself in the room and turned the music on, all the cons stood paralyzed on the ground, listening to the magical tune like the song of hope they had never heard before.Shawshank is more than a feel good movie, it's about life-changing experiences, about the endless struggle against life's harshness and unfairness, about true friends who will stand by you forever... The simple yet hard to convey messages could not be handled more subtly than this.Shawshank should have won every Oscar for any categories it was nominated, but it's all about struggling against unfairness, time's proved its monumental magnitude.Shawshank is a lesson of life that you have to learn in just 150 minutes."
" A very good film, but it's not Papillon
",,"I really liked this movie, which I just recently saw for the first time, strange indeed since it is more than 10 years old. It reminded me, naturally I would say, to Papillon, the 70's McQueen/Hoffman classic.I like the story, the acting, basically everything, and I definitely recommend it to everybody. But compared to Papillon? There are so many similarities that one has to think that idea of the movie did not came out of the blue. Because of that the movie has to accept to be compared with Papillon. And Papillon is simply even better. It is emotionally much more touching, and when even Freeman's great performance doesn't match Hoffman's, there is no doubt that Robbins is not close to McQueen - in that role I mean! Tim gave a great performance but his role didn't give him the chance that Steve had.Anyway, a joy to watch. But please watch the ""original"" too, it's not old-fashioned at all! I can only guess, but I think the huge differential of 9.1 for SR and 7.9 for Papillon is because most young people have never seen Papillon."
" Easy-breezy, obvious as a child's lie.
",spoiler,"Shawshank Redemption (1994)The short of it: I asked some students what their favorite movie was, and some of them (many of them) said, ""Shawshank Redemption,"" and I said, ""I haven't even seen it."" And they assigned it to me as homework. I started watching, and after about twenty minutes I realized I had, in fact, seen it before.That's how memorable it was for me.I also see that Shawshank has the highest user rating of any film on IMDb. What do these other intelligent, movieloving people see that I don't? I wish I could know, but I can't except by reading their comments. And here, then, finally, is mine.First of all, I don't think it's a terrible film, despite all the picking I do. I'm trying to be analytical. But when I take one aspect and think about it independently, and compare it to other movies I like, it starts to look weak for specific reasons, which is good to know. Please don't read further if you just want a confirmation of why this is a great film. In brief, I don't think Shawshank probes, invents, or seduces aesthetically. It's just a nice story well told.First, that story. Stephen King is a successful writer, to say the least, and a really good ""wordsmith."" His stories work with simple conflicts, and they are plot driven--one thing happens, another thing happens, a third thing is almost necessary to have happen, a twist, a turn, and always, from what I can tell, a nice wrap up. That's pretty much the plot in Shawshank. There is almost no depth to the characters--they are stereotypes, not made of foamcore maybe, but flimsy. There is the evil warden, of course. There is the thoughtful black man who everyone likes, played by Morgan Freeman (who narrates), and the thoughtful white man who doesn't like anyone (at first), played by Tim Robbins.Of course, it goes from there, but really, the ""twists"" are old ones. The plot is the framework for something I found more irritating, and that was a slightly glib tone. The story was not really ""realistic"" in any sense, though the trappings of actual prison life are all there, from rape in the back room to corruption in the front office. Maybe as a ""fable"" it can get away with its airiness, right up to the final happy ending. It might not need any grounding in reality. As a fable it would naturally avoid complexity, or even anything independently interesting. What I mean is, maybe the journey through these familiar clichés, done with a fuzzy, congenial ease, is self-satisfying on purpose. And therefore Shawshank Redemption is heartwarming and enjoyable, to use two words that are as exciting together as milk and warm.But it was this breezy tone that made it unwatchable for me. I had to fastforward through a few parts in the second half (it was my second time seeing it). It seemed that nothing happening! Nothing I hadn't seen before in other movies. It struck me not as mythic or spiritual (those are words people use) but as false, as anti-meaningful because it's obvious, familiar, comforting.The film-making? Let's tick off some basics. Editing: conventional, and downright slow. You can argue the pace was leisurely and luxurious to draw the viewer in. Or you can say it's drawn out and sluggish.Music: functional and familiar, ""movie music"" pure and simple, in its lush seduction, which is offputting once you pay attention to it directly.Script: hmmmm. The writing is not distracting or ""bad"" especially, but that's hardly a recommendation. It gets the information across. But really, read some lines, repeat a few scenes out loud. There are those now famous lines, about everyone being innocent and so on, but most of the movie doesn't crackle--even other Hollywood heartwarmers like Die Hard have more inventiveness. Isn't Shawshank presenting Hallmark sentiments?Acting: exactly what the film needed for its pace and intentions. No faulting Freeman or Robbins there.Photography: professional. If there was a movie crying out for some great filming, this is one, with a great interior to exploit and some good night scenes. But the camera work is functional, with a few moments of higher drama (the prisoner getting shot from above, the escape sequence). But look how often the scenes are just filmed ""nicely"" so that we enjoy being there. Maybe this is the idea, to be caressed and not assaulted--it's not an action adventure film, so I don't expect to be shocked. Direction: finally, the lynchpin person here needs to be accountable. Oh, I'm sure Frank Darabont doesn't mind the cult status of his movie, but he probably knows he is no auteur, but rather rode the coattails of a lot of talented craftspeople around him. But those other people all had to count on him to ask for (and deliver) something with more originality, beauty, surprise, depth, and compactness than the Shawshank we have. It's not a shame, obviously, that we have what we have, because so many people love it, really really love it. I didn't care for his other well known film either, The Green Mile, and so again, it's just what you want from your two hours of absorption.But it brings me back to where I started, which is to realize that there are all kinds of viewers, and movies to match. This one didn't go the places I need a great movie to go. It's not a bad movie, not at all. In fact, this might be a classic example of a movie being much more than the sum of its parts. But, still, even the whole strikes me as flip and easy-breezy, obvious as child's lie. It is content to be superficial, and I, personally, am not."
" I may be in the minority here but.......
",,"I have literally just turned off the DVD player after watching this film for the very first (and last) time after so much hype I thought it was about time. I sat all the way through it and did enjoy it, but I really don't see what all the fuss is about. Yes it is a good film, yes it is a good plot. However I had guessed the outcome and a few bits within the film before the flashback at the end, and therefore for me there were no unexpected twists. I wasn't even moved at the end. In fact all in all I was a bit disappointed, as my friends who have seen it said that they had cried and it was such a brilliant film. Am I abnormal???????? I think the green mile was better and I did cry at the end of that. I'm sorry if I upset any of you who think it is the best film ever, but I don't."
" Simply a great story that is moving and uplifting
",spoiler,"Andy Defresne is a young banker who goes to pieces when he learns his wife is being unfaithful.  He gets drunk and wakes in his car, where he is picked up for the murder of his wife and her lover.  Despite his pleas of innocence, Andy is sentenced to life in prison where he is immediately introduced to the horrors of live inside.  Fellow lifer, Red, tells Andy's story of how he held hope and managed to use his banking skills to improve the conditions for himself and others.I saw this film in the cinema when it came out and, looking back, it is surprising how little fuss was made over it at the time - I was one of 15 or 20 people in the cinema when I saw it (on it's second week out!).  However time has brought it to the top of many popular lists of films and it is mainly due to a story that is based around friendship and hope that engages and eventually uplifts.If you are going to adapt a Stephen King book, the lesson from this film and others appears to be to adapt a short one.  Here the story is set up well with all the usual stuff that we expect from prison dramas, but with the key difference that these events are not the film - no the film is about Andy and Red's friendship.  These two men are great characters and I was very easily drawn into their story.  It is witty, dark and yet enjoyable all at the same time.  It is impossible not to be affected by the ending and this simple uplifting sentiment is part of the reason it has been taken in by so many viewers as one of their favourites.Of course it is a little long at times and for my personal tastes it is a little too sentimental at times although this is to be expected with any Hollywood film.  The slightly sentimental view of the prison also goes so far to ignore the idea that there would be any homosexual relationship that aren't rape and even ruling out any suggestion of racism - there is no tension or segregation in evidence here.  I won't do spoilers but the ending was too clear for me where leaving us with more questions would have been more in holding with the idea of hope that the film had traded in prior to this.  The characters work well due to some great performances.  Robbins is great as Andy and he ages and grows well - whether or not he is believable in his calm approach to the punishment he takes is another matter, but I was caught up in the film enough to get past that.  Freeman may not be the Irish guy from the book (hence the name Red) but he is excellent as the father figure - even if he appears to age very slowly in comparison to Andy.  The chemistry between the two is the key and it really works.Of course having a support cast that includes a great number of fine support actors probably helped.  People like Gunton, Sadler, Bellows and others may not always be great but here they fit the bill. Yes the characters tend to be very clichéd (the bird man, the rapists etc) but again that comes with the genre and I was able to get past these by focusing on the main relationship.  The surprise performance for me was from Clancy Brown - not the most subtle of actors (Highlander is his other famous role) but he is very good here indeed, albeit with little actual character depth.  As director Darabont has done very well, framing some great shots (that crane shot as the bus arrives for the first time) as well as a shot that has become almost iconic.  He is helped by a score that fits the sweeping sense of hope that the film brings.Overall this is an imperfect film and it is flattered by it regular high appearance on the popular `best film' lists.  However it is also a great little story that twists and turns as it is told, it has all the clichés of the genre but at it's heart it is based on friendship and a sense of hope that it is hard not to find uplifting.  For all it's faults it is a popular and moving story that seems to do the trick for the majority of those that see it."
" Sure it's good, but no. 2 of all time???
",,"Sure it was a good prison movie, and much better than many other movies I've seen.  But this does NOT beat Godfather, Star Wars, or Casablanca in any way.  Watch this if you enjoy good performances and good plot, but don't expect a present-day classic ala Forrest Gump."
" ""I Had To Go To Prison To Learn To Be A Crook""
",,"None of the usual otherworld creatures that populate the works of Stephen King are to be found in The Shawshank Redemption. But the real world of that Maine prison has some bizarre rules of its own and there's a whole new reality within those walls.In the tradition of Cool Hand Luke and Birdman Of Alcatraz comes Tim Robbins who was a banker on the outside, but when he caught his wife cheating on him with a golf pro from their country club, he's convicted of putting eight bullets in them, four apiece and tried and sentenced to two consecutive life terms in Shawshank prison. Like Luke and Bob Stroud he works out his own rehabilitation and rebels against the prison system.He may be a con, but Robbins still has all his knowledge of finances and pretty soon he's made himself quite invaluable to the warden and the rest of the staff at the prison. At the same time he and the cell block scrounger Morgan Freeman develop a close personal relationship. In the end they beat the system in a most unique way.There have been some classic prison films made ever since The Big House at the dawn of the talkies. Two I've already mentioned. My favorite prison film is Robert Redford's Brubaker, but The Shawshank Redemption comes pretty close. As does The Green Mile which was also directed by Frank Darabont.Darabont got an Oscar nomination as did the film itself and as did Morgan Freeman for Best Actor. The Shawshank Redemption was in for a flock more Oscar nominations in 1994. A couple other good performances are that of James Whitmore the institutionalized con who is there for 50 years and paroled and just can't make it on the outside. He will break your heart as will Gil Bellows who plays a fresh, but rather likable young con who runs afoul of the warden.Speaking of which Bob Gunton as the warden will positively chill you with his corruption. You would have to go back all the way to the James Cagney classic, The Mayor Of Hell where Dudley Digges was the warden of boys reformatory to find a warden that is as sanctimonious and as corrupt as Gunton. This is a man who gives Bibles out to each inmate hoping that the reading of the Good Book will improve the moral fiber of the convicts. At the same time he's raking in money every which way he can and a rather special punishment is meted out to him by Robbins.The Shawshank Redemption may not have monsters and other worldly creatures that normally characterize a Stephen King story. But the world of Shawshank prison is bizarre enough for any normal person if you see this wonderfully crafted and acted film."

" Superb prison buddy story - but sadly unimportant film
",,"If you simply see this as a straightforward storytelling prison film, then it is excellent (10/10) because it truly gets you involved in its main character. It is an extremely enjoyable and compelling experience with a heartfelt and well-acted buddy-story at its core. It delicately--and sometimes brutally--juxtaposes Andy Dufresne's (Tim Robbins) good-natured character with the harshness of prison life, projecting so much heart in doing so.However delightful as it is, The Shawshank Redemption has no allegories and no statements to make and it brought nothing new to cinema in either style or substance. It had no revolutionary ideas or approaches - it's only a very safe buddy-story. A damn good one, but still just that. So it can impossibly be a film that will be remembered or studied, because what will it be remembered for? Friendship? Huh, neat. I therefore don't think it's entirely deserving of being considered the #2 greatest film of all time on IMDb.com.But moving on and looking past that, it is possibly one of my all-time favourite films for the feelings it leaves. Sure, it often jerks you for tears just a bit too purposely, but this is forgivable because emotion is crucial to a prison story. On top of that, it never falls prey to predictable sappiness - probably because of its content which is devoid of sentimental romance and instead fills you up with a tragic friendship. It is so well-sewn together by a feel-good narrative by Morgon Freeman that it is impossible not to enjoy this film.9/10"
" Once in a lifetime movie
",,"An excellent movie that can surely move you a bit. It throws open the question that can we really have prisons which are redemption centers in the true sense. At the same time, it redefines the word criminal. Are the heinous acts committed by administrative authorities justifiable by any means. There should be a code of conduct for the authorities and a HOLY PRISON MAINTENANCE BIBLE if any reformation has to take place. The movie goes through several touching incidents and may bore you a bit if you rarely sees serious touching movies and are fans of slick sci-fi thrillers moving at extraordinary pace like Matrix etc. However the exceptional acting by lead stars particularly by Morgan Freeman and the picking up of the tempo in the second half will leave you gasping for more. After Citizen Kane, Casablanca & Godfather, it is another classic that will stay in the echelons of the movie rating lists for long. There are a few weak points though. There was insufficient attention given to some characters and movie portrays just one side of the whole story not remaining fair to the prison authorities. And finally if it was told in a non-linear tale then it would have been much more interesting"
" A genre picture, but a satisfying one...
",,"Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of double murder who is sent to jail, eventually befriending other lifers including Morgan Freeman's Ellis Redding. Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" (in the film version, it's really Raquel Welch, not Rita, who aids in the ultimate twist). On the surface, it's another prison-genre picture with the usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden, a cruel guard, a few homosexuals, and a quirky old-timer who doesn't want his parole. However, the film's emotions run surprisingly deep, justice is well served by the conclusion, and several of the cast members carve out amazing, three-dimensional characterizations. The finale is pure fantasy, however it does provide the audience with the release it needs, and Robbins and Freeman are excellent. Long, involved, but engrossing and satisfying, ""Shawshank"" was not a big hit at the box-office but found a devoted following on video and cable. **1/2 from ****"
" Fantastic
",,"This particular movie is the absolute best ever and should be rated #1 of all times.With all the pages of comments that have been posted on this site; I will not even attempt to add to the eloquence of the previous comments.I have noticed that many people have posted that they did not see this movie in the theaters. I would not even watch the movie on VHS as my wife and children begged me to take a look at the film.The title did not appeal to me and I did not understand the title. I don't particularly like any prison movies. I just would not watch the film and I was probably watching ten movies per week at that time.I finally watched when one night; I could find nothing appealing in the video store. From that moment in 1997; I've probably watched the movie about 20 times per year for the last eight years.People refer to all the ""classics"" as being such masterpieces; but, I disagree. ""Citizen Kane"", ""Some Like It Hot"", ""African Queen"", Casablanca"", ""Godfather"" and all the others can not compete with anything about this movie."
" 2nd best film ever?
",,"This movie is good, there's no question about that, but he 2nd best ever? That's a bit of a stretch. I can't really imagine that all of those people who gave this movie the 9 and 10 votes have seen very many other good movies.  Sure, the story is meaningful and it's harsh etc, but there are so many movies that are moving and powerful.  The fact that Shawshank is #2 on this list is a reflection of those voting."
" Hope is a dangerous thing
",spoiler,"'The Shawshank Redemption'... hmm where do I start. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is clearly one of the greatest films ever, I find that it really can show what it would be like trapped in a tiny little prison, eventually you would only think of what's outside the prison instead of inside or you might even become attached to the prison or should I say home.What the audience really enjoy's about this movie is that you have been deceived for you believe through out most of the movie that there is noway out for poor Andy Dufresne and that he is trying to be nice to the guards for a chance of believable. After that you discover that the whole film and everything that has happened has all gone towards the escape of Andy Dufresne and the suicide of the dreadful warden. The audience has been gullible enough to believe that Andy was getting used to the prison. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is clearly not just a movie, it is also beautiful art. Every little piece of the movie was delicately put together to create pure yet daunting art.The story is about Andy Dufresne a wealthy intelligent banker who's wife is having an affair with another man. Eventually both the wife and the other man are killed while having sex, with all evidence pointing to Andy, Andy is sentenced to two life times of prison. In prison Andy does a lot of the workers at the prison's (and that include's the warden) banking. From then of the story is all about Andy in the prison and he idea's of hope and love of music.One of the most beautiful and touching moments in the movie is when Andy locks all the doors in the room that has the microphone and plays opera music of two Italian women singing opera in Italian. Morgen Freeman then say's that he had no idea what the two Italian women were singing but doesn't want to know, he just like to imagine that the words were too beautiful to be sung in English.The acting is brilliant and the directing is directed absolutely unbelievably tremendous. I praise both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins for a very touching movie that I will always remember.In conclusion, 'The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest films ever that I have ever seen, if you do not like it I will also understand that you didn't listen closer to the brilliant word that were able to come out of the actors mouth.Hope is a dangerous thing."
" Instantly put on my top-5 of all time list
",,"Let me tell you a little story. I am 17 years old and consider myself an avid movie buff. From Braveheart to American History X to Pulp Fiction to Schindler's List to The Matrix, I thoroughly enjoy watching and talking about great movies. After being desensitized by the poor gore-fest known as Hostel, I came home and watched this movie with some friends. Let me tell you that this is one of two movies I can think of that has made me tear up. I don't do it often, and I certainly wasn't expecting to tonight. But the Shawshank Redemption tantalizes your mind and touches your soul. It is a triumph of motion picture and tonight became of of my top five favorite movies of all time. Please go see this in its entirety if you have not."
" My second favorite movie of all time
",,"Shawshank is one of the only movies I have ever scored as 10 out of 10. I had read the Stephen King short long before I saw the movie, and loved it, but had no idea going into the movie that it was the same story. Halfway thru the movie I finally put two and two together and almost jumped out of my seat at the theater to say ""OMG, I love this story!"" Fortunately I managed to resist and hide the fact that I'm totally freaking insane for at least one more day...But I digress. The movie stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufraine, a man convicted of murdering his wife. He is sentenced to life at Shawshank prison. Although convicted of the same type of brutal crime as his fellow inmates, it quickly becomes apparent that Andy is an oddity at Shawshank. Highly educated, quiet and philosophical, Andy is initially a source of curiosity and unease to his fellow inmates but is soon befriended by Ellis 'Red' Redding, played by Morgan Freeman, and quickly becomes one of their own.Without giving too much away, the movie follows Andy's life in prison, as narrated by Freeman, as he finds a way to both survive and hold on to a shred of his humanity in a place that seeks to rob him of both. Andy learns, for example, to bargain with what he has (i.e. his financial knowledge) for what he needs. Initially, many of the things Andy acquires during the course of the film seem to have little value, but you realize by the end of the film that what he has asked for has had value beyond measure, both in the pragmatic sense and in a deeper philosophical sense.The movie is at its core an exploration of what it is to be human. It is about loss, regret, perseverance, friendship, and ultimately, faith. How do we deal with the mistakes that we have made in life? How do we recover when life beats us down? And how can we seek strength in our connections to others? These are all ideas that Shawshank looks at. It is alternately funny, tragic, violent, and inspirational. Probably one of the best stories King ever wrote and without question one of the best films ever made."
" Those lil´ movies that...
",,"This movie is one of those ones that makes you think really deep about life, your life!       Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith, in a dark atmosphere."
" The greatest transition from confinement to freedom ever portrayed in film
",,"Not only is this film one of the most touching I have ever seen, it also has one of the most unexpected and inspiring endings I have ever seen.  The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best I've heard"
" Movie you can see 1000 times
",spoiler,"I made my account on IMDb Just to Rate this movie. :-) I had heard from someone that Tim Robins has done a great job in this movie. but when i started watching this movie, i could not move my ass for 142 Min.its not just about Tim Robins or Morgen Freeman.. its the whole storyline,dialogs and cinematography which insist you to watch this whenever you feel low in your life.Movie has some great lines. When Andy(Tim Robins) brake the Jail, Morgon Freeman says ""I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright"" This movie has entertainment, Feelings, Action, Drama a little comedy. In short everything we want to see in a movie.I have seen this movie around 100 times and sure will watch more then 10000 times before i die. 1 of the best movies i have ever seen in my life.. Wish i could see that sort of movie again in my life"
" the best movie in the world ever made
",,"simply the best movie ever made. this movie embraces the philosophy that justice will be done, karma is heard and that goodness will rule above anything in this world. Andy and reds friendship is a strong unique bond, founded under the harshest of circumstances. In prison they each serve their time for situations they got themselves into, but certainly didn't form them as men - or messed with their true character. Andy has no choice but to try and accept his fate, that he will be in Shawshank forever - and on the surface he rises to the occasion by doing the paperwork for the sadistic warden, who treats Andy like the lowest of the low. In the meantime Reds parole is continuously declined, and they both have to re-adjust, even though their life in prison sometimes offers them glimpses of hope and of freedom. Will the time really come, and if yes...are they ready for it?"
" Magical film
",,"I remember when i first saw this film. my friend kept telling me to watch it as he thought it was brilliant. well, all good things come to those who wait yes? i did something I had never done before or since: when i finished watching it i rewound it and watched it again straight after.It has a perfect cast, story and the best ending of any film i have ever seen.To sum up in one word: magical!"
" Papillion is much better
",,"Oh come on 2nd best movie ever, I don't think so.  It's unrealistic and overly sentimental, the people who voted so high can't have seen many films. By all means watch it, but Papillion for example, is far superior, who can forget Steve McQueen's red rimmed eyes and pasty face as he catches bugs, and crushes centipedes into his watery broth to get nourishment in that incredible portrayal of hardship and determination.  I wouldn't put Papillion as the 2nd best film of all time, but it has to be the best Prison drama.  Watch Shawshank and you'll enjoy it as a lightweight entertaining feel good movie, but there are so many classic films better than this."
" The greatest movie ever!
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is easily my favorite movie of all time. It has every single element that should be looked for in a film. A brilliant script (with the best dialogue ever written), a perfect cast (not one bad performance), and not to mention an original, complex and ultimately uplifting story.Based on the Stephen King novel, Shawshank Redemption is a delight from first scene to last. The opening is a brilliantly done sequence with Andy's (Tim Robbins) trial intercut with his actions on the night of his crime. This leads to him being taken to Shawshank with one of the best shots ever captured on film, with the camera sweeping from behind the prison bus in the air and diving into the middle of the prison yard. There Andy meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and others, and a gradual friendship begins to develop.This movie has that certain indefinable screen magic, every line of dialogue spoken has real conviction and meaning, and the performances in this movie are nothing short of magnificent. Tim Robbins delivers his best screen performance ever, as the quietly spoken Andy. Here is a character like no other, so vivid, so real, that you can't help but like him. Morgan Freeman also delivers his best work ever as Red, Andy's friend. Freeman, while playing a different character from Robbins, is also able to give off a quiet dignity for his character. The supporting cast is perfect. From Bob Gunton, chillingly evil, but never over the top as to become cartoonish, as the Warden. Clancy Brown, as the prison Guard Hadley is brilliant, as is Veteran James Whitmore, as Brooks, who while given relatively small screen time is brilliant as the lifer con who's sad journey the film details.There is not a dull moment or poor line of dialogue in this film. Credit first time director Frank Darabont for this remarkable piece of work. He is a director of the future. I still can't believe this was his first movie!, he will find it hard to top this masterful film. Special mention must be made of the music score by Thomas Newman, who has composed a simple, but perfect score for this film. His scoring of the scene with Andy and Red sitting up against the wall discussing their plans for release is nothing short of brilliant, as is the rest of his score.I encourage everyone who has not seen this to grab it now, as it is surely not only the best movie of the 90's but the best movie of all time.
***** out of *****"
" So it's not everyday that you watch the greatest movie of your lifetime.
",,"I will always remember the night I watched this movie for the first time. I was 16-years-old and my dad and I were pretty bored late on a school night. So naturally I say to my father, ""Dad, I think it's time to watch Shawshank"". I almost regret watching it. It is that good. It's like nothing I ever see in my lifetime can ever compare to the emotional roller coaster that 'The Shawshank Redemption' takes you on.First question I usually ask people when discussing films is, ""So have you seen Shawshank?"". No matter what their reply is I am happy with the outcome because if they say no, then they are yet to see the greatest movie of all time. If they say yes, I have something to talk to them about for the next 27 minutes.You probably still won't believe me when I tell you that this is the greatest film you will ever see. It's that good that I actually told one of my friends not to watch it until she was on her deathbed. Then she will see this movie without ever having to compare anything else to it. Now when I see a movie all I think is, I've already seen the best.Now actually getting onto maybe even reviewing this masterpiece (not that any summary of the plot could ever do it justice). So all I will say is this, I have never heard anyone give this movie a bad review. Do yourself a favour and don't even bother to finish reading this. Just go and watch it."
" ""I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning"".
",spoiler,"Well I guess I'm a little late to the party as far as writing down a review for this picture. I've seen it a couple of times, but that was before I became a regular contributor to the IMDb. When I first discovered this site a few years ago, ""The Godfather"" was in the Number #1 spot, and since then the films have traded places for first and second, with Shawshank maintaining the top spot most of the time. That puzzled me a bit until I watched it again tonight, and I've come away from the picture with a new found appreciation. My favorite movies tend to be the story of underdogs in some way, shape or form, and my personal Top Ten list includes titles like ""On The Waterfront"", ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". I may have to reconsider that list, an infrequent exercise but one I don't mind doing every now and then as situations warrant.Overall, the film is darn near perfect. I know it's pretty cliché to state it that way, but when you analyze the dialog, the characters, the directing and the tone of the movie, the picture flows flawlessly, even when it detours into side stories like Brooks Hatlen's release and new prisoner Tommy's introduction late in the picture. Every set-up, every nuance has some importance that eventually converges to symbolize Andy's quest for escape and personal redemption. Remember Brooks feeding Jake for the first time and eventually setting him free when he receives his own pardon? How about Andy playing Mozart into the prison yard while settling back with a smile of contentment on his face. The story transcends one man's confinement for a crime he didn't commit, and focuses instead on his reaction to circumstances beyond his control. Paul Newman showed us a different way to react to those kinds of conditions in 1967's ""Cool Hand Luke"", but his method was self destructive. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) never loses his ability to keep his eye on the prize, even if it takes him a couple of decades to do so.But even more so, you have here the story of Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman), a convict who sees Andy as a person, and over time, an inspiration to himself and the rest of the prisoners who call him friend. From Andy, he comes to understand that even as a prisoner, a man can live life on his own terms if he can keep his mind uncluttered by thoughts of desperation and hopelessness. Not bad for a convict who started out believing that 'hope can drive a man insane'.I really can't recommend this picture highly enough, both for it's masterful story telling and it's technical execution. The actors, even those portraying the most minor characters were seemingly born for their roles. They deliver a seamless performance that's virtually unmatched by most modern films, in a picture that hits all the right notes with an inspiring message of discipline and perseverance."
" The best movie ever, excellent is a small word for this movie!
",,"I am bowled over by this movie. This is simply the best movie ever made. The story just leaves you moved and the performances in the movie are clearly the best performances ever on screen. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman enact their roles to perfection, they don't miss out even a dot in fulfilling the roles to excellency.I cant believe i waited so long before i actually watched this movie, i should have watched it before, and then over and over again.Don't be scared to watch this movie, you will be amazed by this masterpiece. I cant stop raving, I say WATCH IT NOW! 10 on 10 isn't enough!"
" Perfectly written. Perfectly directed. Perfectly cast. Perfectly acted. Perfect
",,"I have seen The Shawshank Redemption twice now, the second time being about a week ago. After the first time I saw it, I gave it a perfect 10 rating on IMDb, something I do very rarely (I've given out 20 ratings of 10 out of the 600+ movies I've rated). However, after just one viewing, I felt so impacted by this film that it immediately rocketed near the top of my favorite movie list. After a second viewing, I feel even more amazed by it than I was the first time I saw it. The movie captures your interest in the first scene and unfolds new plot points and character developments slowly at first and then more rapidly as the movie goes on. The movie runs about 130 minutes long, but it never gets boring. While it is admittedly slow paced, this only serves into its greatness. It allows the viewer to get to know the characters of Andy and Red and sympathize with them; along the way, we also get to know and grow attached to the other prisoners trapped inside Shawshank. The movie flows perfectly from one scene to the next, never feeling forced or losing your interest. The movie is mostly dialogue driven, but there are some violent scenes which help convey the brutality of prison life.Finally, the final 30 minutes are perhaps the most satisfying in any movie. I do not want to spoil the ending for those who have never seen it, but suffice to say, the final act of the movie leaves you floored. Both times that I saw it, I was rooted to my seat long after the credits rolled, just thinking about the brilliance of the ending and the entire movie as a whole. Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction are both great movies, highly entertaining. I particularly love Pulp Fiction; however, it is a travesty that The Shawshank Redemption did not win Best Picture. It was certainly the best film of the year in my opinion, arguably the best film of the decade, and perhaps one of the finest movies ever made. The even bigger tragedy, though, is that while Morgan Freeman earned an Oscar nomination for his great performance, Tim Robbins' turn as Andy Dufresne went without a nomination. Robbins carries the film, and his performance is truly one of the greatest I have ever seen. The bottom line is that The Shawshank Redmption is a perfect movie. It takes you in from the opening scene and doesn't let you go until long after it comes to a tremendous close. Along the way, it will make you think, fear, wonder, and feel a number of other emotions. If you have not seen this movie, waste no time; go rent it today and see why this is the highest ranked film on IMDb."
" This is a film that you live, not watch
",,"To call The Shawshank Redemption a great film would be doing it no justice at all. This is a film that when I watched it the first time I couldn't believe how good it was.  I expected a film that would pass the time by, and I got a film that I could identify with.  If you are feeling sad, and you think the world's a rubbish place, this fills you with hope.  I love the opening scene where the camera pans around the prison, and then the music kicks in, it makes you feel awe-inspired.  The acting was brilliant, you believed what everyone said (some films the words are delivered with such cheesiness and fake ness, that it makes you want to throw up). I have watched Spiderman, and even the lines in that make you feel that they mean nothing, they just sound good. 
The film and book reciprocated the message 'Hope Springs Eternal', which means so much because we always live in hope that tomorrow it will be better, things might change for us, and hope never dies. 
I think, when Tim Robbins speaks about music, how you can never take it away, because it's in your head.  If I have a rubbish day at work, then it's true that music just lifts you, which is re-emphasised with the scene where he plays the music full blast around the prison (this of example of piece of script, which means, so much). The movie uses music to it's full potential to give more impact to the words and the characters.  This film cannot replicated, because the film is a piece of art, the Director wanted to make money, but he also wanted to make a piece of film that made you feel something, that had some effect on you after the movie was over. The movie has no bad points it's what a story should be about, it takes you somewhere that you nether been, and makes you feel you lived that experience, and you can learn from that experience.  The lines delivered, will always be remembered 'Get busy living, or get busy dying' (this is the dilemma we face in everyday live).  This will live in my memories forever, not like the sorry cash-ins of movies.  This is a brief synopsis of how great the movie is, but words just seem so little to explain the brilliance of this film."
" One word. Outstanding.
",,"Now, I see what everybody was talking about. It took me 4 years to see this, in my opinion, masterpiece. If you have not seen this movie rent it anyway you can. The performances delivered by Robbins and Freeman are, to me, the pinnacle of both their careers. This film cannot help but evoke tactile imagery to the fullest capacity. You feel what the main characters are going through the sensation is uncanny. Robbins (Andy) and Freeman (""Red"") are a balance of the human spirit. Andy is your freedom-seeking hope side and ""Red"" is your rational, pessimistic counterpart. Find your equilibrium in ""The Shawshank Redemption."""
" Robbed at the Academy Awards
",,"By far Shawshank was the best film of 1994. But look who it was up against at the Oscars...Forrest Gump. It's not that Forrest Gump was such a horrible movie as alot of people make it out to be, in fact it was good. But it was also a very hyped movie. The public ate it up, and they also got too much of it. That might be the reason everybody on the internet seems to hate it so. But to say Forrest Gump is better than the Shawshank Redemtion is a far cry. I wish the Oscar's didn't do this all the time. They vote on who they think the public wants to win it seems like sometimes. It was robbed. But that doesn't make it any less of a film. It's a triumph of filmmaking. Robbins and Freeman are excellent. The character Brooks is terrific, and the warden is protrayed perfectly by Bob Gunton. Go rent this movie, if it's the last thing you do. The ending is one of the most satisfying in movie history."
" Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things.
",,"Truly a masterpiece of cinema.  I hope this film gets the critical recognition it deserves as the years go by.  Almost everyone i have encountered has loved this film.  How did it not win oscars galore.  Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman are simply perfect in what is essentially a love story.  A love of hope, a love of friendship and a love of life, no matter the constraints.  I LOVE THIS FILM!"
" The movie that wouldn't end
",spoiler,"Ok.  It wasn't that bad.  In fact, there's a lot to like about this movie. But there was absolutely no reason why this movie needed to go on and on and on and on.Excellent acting of course:  Freeman is always right on target and Tim Robbins is very good (although I happen to dislike his political views and that inhibits my ability to imagine he's anyone else but Robbins up there on the screen).Its a movie that makes one think about the important things in life, and it does that without being preachy.However, I don't like the way it uses cliches all the way through, i.e. the bad warden who is a pseudo-Christian.  Hollywood has shown much hatred towards Christianity,  and this is only one more movie in a long string which tries to make Christians look bad.****spoilers ahead********
Also, it is simply not believable that (a) the prison would not have moved Andy in 19 years of prison life, and (b) the sound of his rock scraping wouldn't have been heard and (c) he wouldn't have been seen ""underneath"" the poster, working away at the wall.I find it hard to believe furthermore, that Andy would go back into the town where he proposed, just to leave money under that rock.  An escaped convict would not want to be anywhere near where people may recognize him, if he had any smarts, which Andy did.But those things alone did not prevent me from enjoying the movie, I just don't think the movie lived up to its hype, and I would feel no need to ever watch it again (and I always watch my favs over and over again!)."

What I can say is that it is true that this movie is a bit overrated but it still deserves to be called a masterpiece.There is something about The Shawshank Redemption that creates a specific atmosphere and makes you not only watch but experience it. I have read the book and I have to admit that I enjoyed the movie more. The combination of outstanding acting, great directing and well written script makes this movie the masterpiece it is.I really don't have anything bad to say about this movie except for its high place in the IMDB top 250's list. It is an amazing movie but it still doesn't deserve to be called the best as there are many others that are equally good or even better. But still, this movie should be on everyone's list of must watch movies."

" Fantastic movie
",,"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie."
" Very best movie i ever watch
",,"The story is described by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the dividers of Shawshank Prison for quite a while and is its driving business visionary. He can get you whatever you require: cigarettes, confection, even a little shake pick like a beginner geologist may utilize. One day he and his kindred detainees watch the most recent busload of detainees empty, and they make wagers on who will cry amid their first night in jail, and who won't. Red wagers on a tall, slender person named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who resembles an innocent bystander. In any case, Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he bet. Andy ends up being an amazement to everybody in Shawshank, in light of the fact that inside him is such an intense supply of assurance and quality that nothing appears to break him. Andy was a financier all things considered, and he's in for murder. He's clearly blameless, and there are a wide range of points of interest including his case, yet before long they go up against a sort of illusion; every one of that numbers inside jail is its own general public - who is solid, who is not - and the deliberate section of time. Red is likewise a lifer. Now and again, measuring the decades, he goes up before the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and inquire as to whether he supposes he has been restored. Goodness, most without a doubt, yes, he answers; however the fire leaves his confirmations as the years walk past, and there is the feeling that he has been standardized - that, similar to another old lifer who murders himself in the wake of being paroled, he can no longer truly imagine life all things considered."
" The only time I'd call anything The Best Film Ever Made.
",,"This is it, I have always been so careful on not getting carried away while watching great films and calling it the best. I am talking about the league of The Godfather, Casablanca, The Good The Bad & The Ugly and 12 Angry Men. So I always called each of them one of the best. I never believed THE BEST ever existed. It can't be, right? How can anything be the best or perfect. Definitely not perfect film. There's got to be something wrong somewhere I just need to look close enough.But I was wrong. Although I knew I was all the way. Right from the very first time I watched The Shawshank Redemption on HBO in 1997 (18 years ago) and I waited 18 years, 5 thorough viewings, 1 sceptical review before I wrote my final judgment of this film. This is the best film ever made. Spotless. True classic. And it was not even directed or acted by the legends we know today. Sure they are true legends. But what Frank Dorabont, Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman & their amazing crew did is something extra special. They created the best work on cinema ever with almost none of those legends working on them. This film needs no further description. Ten out of ten in every department of film making. Full of incredible moments. Beauty, class and intellect in almost every scene. You do not need to know the No.1 film status on IMDb for over a decade to actually believe in the power of this genius work of art. This is the best, if there is one. This is the film that reaffirmed my faith in hope, human perseverance and friendship. I'm sure there are many who believe this isn't that great, but I am glad I think otherwise - and believe me, its a great feeling. Of having found the best film, being a huge film lover. 10/10 - the only time I ever did or would do this on IMDb or elsewhere."

But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul.

" great

Of course a good soundtrack also makes a great movie, so the soundtrack also has to be mentioned. The Movie Picture is very good. good angles of shooting, always transmitting us the space inside the prison. or rather the space that we have not. And finally, check out this great movie. they repented and were left with a better perspective for life. See the movie, enjoy and learn! To finish just saying that it as a great movie, oh wait, i already said that, no problem its to highlight the idea."
" A fantastic movie to enjoy

It touch a social problem that few movie directors and producers took the risk of doing like the institutionalized thing. All of the stories developed in this movie even if they are all related of the main character, every own little story is very interesting and full of emotions. This movie contains good drama, a different comedy insight. I think I have seen this movie at least 6 times and I just don't get tire of watch in it i think every time i watch it i found new things.I highly recommend to spend time enjoying this amazing movie and just a piece of advice is take the time to read a little bit the reviw and find no one bad."
" The Best Movie of all Time
",spoiler,"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that creates a sense of mystery and power. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie by displaying their roles as best friends. After watching that movie for the first time, I remembered clips that are drilled into my mind forever. It is beautifully written and directed. The scene that sticks out to me is at the end of the movie when Andy Dufresne and Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding reunite at the end of the movie. This promotes the aspect of friendship that will live on forever. Even though these two men have lived in prison for years, they eventually got out (well Andy escaped) and they still managed to find one of the most important things in their lives, each other. I recommend this movie to all ages. Although this movie may be a complex the first time you watch it, but after several other times, it still creates a sense of thrill and hope for the viewers. 10 out of 10!"
" A film beyond greatness.
",,"I have been into movies since, well I was 5. But after about 15 years I finally was lucky enough to come across this title. I had a huge expectation when I started watching it.Hey! it ain't number 1 for show that much i can vouch for. Well it took me a few minutes to get into it but well once i got engulfed it was just sheer pleasure and goosebumps.The film revolves around the inmates of a prison and a NEW FISH accused of homicide joining the faculty.The film depicts How he changed their lives and helped them to realize and bring back the greatest gift of life taken away from them . The friendship, the hardship, the simplest joy, the tragedies , the yearning for freedom in each breath has been brilliantly acted and directed.The movie makes you feel good.After watching it it makes you smile and strengthens your faith in humanity.I am no critic but this movie made me happy, ecstatic and I would love to re-watch it again and again. so i would say go on watch it at once if you have not. You will love it no matter what your taste in films are. Because this film expresses humanity in each way possible. And as a fellow human being you will love the emotions. If you don't then well I will be a bit surprised.P.S 1994 was the year of Forrest Gump. It took home all the awards. Though it is a great film but in my opinion it remains only great while shawshank is one of the greatest if not the greatest movie of all times. Thank You..."
" A cinematic phenomenon
",,"What can I possibly add to a review corpus of over 1.2 million ratings and three thousand reviews? This movie has been called ""one of the best movies of all time"", ""a powerful story about friendship, hope and freedom"" and a ""latter-day retelling of the Gospel story"". Many people have seen this movie multiple times, and some claim it has changed their lives and even saved their lives.At this point, I'm rather more interested in the phenomenon than the movie. My take on it: this movie appeals enormously to ordinary people (especially American men) who feel trapped by difficult situations in their lives. Some may be looking to be rescued, like Red was; others may take comfort in the thought that their long-term pain, tedium and oppression will someday result in a spectacular liberating event. This movie satisfyingly scratches that annoying itch called ""life is unfair"".It's difficult to know what to think about all this. Whatever you think about the phenomenon, ""Shawshank Redemption"" is also just a good movie with excellent writing, black and white characters, a simple but satisfying plot with a few surprising scenes, great acting, and a certain amount of tear jerking. It's not a movie to be missed."
" What More Can I Say?
",,"There are only a handful of films that have shaken me to my core and continued to resonate with me for very long after their first viewing. I can happily say that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has stuck to me since I finished watching it for the first time, and instantly rocketed up my Top 10 Films list. Most great films have one or two obvious flaws that can be easily picked out - not so in ""Shawshank"", at least not to me. The hefty run time doesn't put me off because the story and characters are just so well rounded and so easy to return to time and time again. ""Shawshank"" is one of those films that I would love to experience for the first time all over again. The thrill of emotions and the highs and lows I felt that first time are incomparable to much else. In my opinion, ""Forrest Gump"" was not as deserving of the Best Picture Oscar as this. The timeless feel of a story of friendship in a hopeless place will likely continue to capture generations of people for years to come."
" Brilliant & Excellent
",,"By far the best movie ever...No Doubt this is the best ever movie you will ever see, It is easily the best movie of my life-time so far.Morgan Free is a legend and Rest of the Crew did a marvellous job as well. Well written / narrated and directed movie of all times.10 out 10.It has been on number one ranking on IMDb and most of the other movie rating websites forever now.The best past of the movie is narrated voice by Morgan Freeman.The character Andy Dufrain is a very well composed and the Warden character has lot of punch into it.Escape from prison was the best it can ever get.Marvellous piece of Art."
" One of my all time favorites.
",,"This film is really an amazing movie timeless. One of my all time favorites. About the long-can write something in a movie. Masters said everything I needed There is not yet aware of the movie and I watched it for people to watch I would like to invite.Than You.Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."
" information
",,"Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) bides his time during twenty years' imprisonment for the murder of his wife in this adaptation of a Stephen King story. And being Stephen King, the setting is once again Maine, though you'll find 'Shawshank State Prison' in Ohio. It's the forbiddingly Gothic Mansfield Reformatory, 100 Reformatory Road, Mansfield, on US Route 30, about 80 miles southwest of Cleveland.Built between 1886 and 1910, the reformatory remained in operation until 1990 and was scheduled for demolition when the film was made. In fact, much of the prison yard has now gone to make room for the adjacent Richland Correctional Institution, but the striking Administration Building lives on as a tourist attraction. Find it just north of downtown Mansfield, off South Olivesburg Road."
" One of the Greatest Films of All Time.
",spoiler,"And I truly mean that. When I first saw this film, I was blown away.With superb acting, superb story, perfect emotion and tone, and an incredible twist ending that still amazes me, this film is completely and utterly perfect. The film speaks of hope, and the film's two main characters debate throughout the movie about it. One character believes that, in prison, hope is dangerous, and that it should not be used because it will simply make life tougher. Another character believes that hope is needed, because it helps you to keep pushing for a better tomorrow when one does not appear to be in sight. While very engaging and immensely entertaining, this film would not be held to such high regards if not for the twist ending, which is one of the greatest movie endings of all time, in my opinion. If the ending is merely average, this film would simply be considered good, possibly great, but not the masterpiece that it is today. And, watching it repeatedly makes the film even better, because experiencing the events that occur within the story makes the ending even greater. I can't speak for everybody, but this is a film that I can watch over and over again, and love it more each time I watch it. And, while I simply talked about the ending this entire review, that is not all that makes this film incredible. However, I will not waste any more of your time talking about how wonderful this film is. And please do not waste any of your own time. Find a way to see this movie as ASAP. It will be time well spent, and you will certainly see it multiple more times."
" My favourite move of all time
",spoiler,"Well let me start off by saying I felt compelled to write this review to spite the numerous people who give it a 1 out of 10 ""because they feel it should be lower then a 9.3"" and go on to write what they really think, to you people I write this: you should vote it according to what you think the movie should be, i.e. if you think the movie deserves an 8 out of 10 then you should vote as such, I think this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 and so I have given it as such.As for the movie, I can't tell you how incredible it is in my opinion, it is the only movie to date I could watch again and again, and not get tired of watching it, the cast was spot on everything was perfect, the subjugation of the prisons by Captain Hadley, all of it was simply spot on, honestly speaking I don't know how people could watch this and fail to see how truly amazing it is, well deserving of its number 1 spot on IMDb.Also I read that people don't understand how Andy ""pinned"" the pictures to his wall, it could be either celotape or bluetac and as you see during the movie, Andy works from under the poster when digging his hole so there is no plot hole of ""how he put the poster back up after entering the hole"" because the poster never gets taken down."
" For Everyone who Gave This Movie a 1
",,"I have written a few reviews on IMDb and Shawshank is one of my favorite movies of all time. I don't necessarily think this movie was a 10 but an easy 9 for me. I am giving it a 10 because of the negative reviews that I read with saying they gave this movie a 1 just because others had given it a 10. As far I'm concerned it's mine to give, if I want to to give every a movie a 10, (which by the way I don't). I am just sick of people telling me that a movie can't be great because it was story driven and not character driven, maybe I like story driven movies, I certainly liked this one. So here's another 10 for you movie snobs will have to eradicate."
" Now here is a classic
",,"This suspense filled, dramatic movie rides high on the plain of self discovery, self worth and self preservation; if an innocent man is locked up for two decades with criminals, nothing else will he learn than to be a criminal himself. There is no better movie that I can recommend you to see than this classic Jail Break that stared one of the best supporting actors you will love to have on your side if you are in the lead role of a movie, Morgan Freeman.Shawshank Redemption was adapted from a Stephen King novella named Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Frank Darabont secured the right to make the film from King in 1987, and he worked intensively on the screenplay for a proper adaptation of the movie, Darabont's screenplay writing earned him an Academy Award nomination, in fact the movie had seven Academy Award nominations and won none.The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is a banker who got convicted for murdering his wife and her lover; he got two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. At Shawshank Andy befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) Red was a contraband smuggler.Andy also developed a nice rapport with the warden and the other guards helping them with their taxes and also helping the warden in his money laundering operation.The movie boast of amazing scenery not to add an impressive cinematography, the movie growth and inclusion and exit of characters will make you feel like you are reading a book, the movie has numerous cast, and it is broken into segments each introducing new casts and each building a parallel wall that guides us to the climatic end.It didn't do well in the box office at all barely making back its production cost, but due to critic's high rating and Academy Award nomination, Golden Globe award nomination and other notable nominations, the movie did well in rental and DVD sales, it is shown regularly on Cable TV, and it has a high following.Frank Darabont who is the director and screenplay writer also made more of King's books; He directed the 1999 Tom Hanks movie The Green Mile which was a box office success compared to this. The Green Mile is another of King's books that is about a prison, and Darabont also directed the 2007 movie The Mist which is also based on a Stephen King book.Here is a DVD every home should have.www.lagsreviews.com"
" Masterful.
",spoiler,"***WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*** In 2007, the American Film Institute released the 10th anniversary edition of their 100 Years...100 Movies list. On this, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" was listed at #72. I find it insulting it was ranked so low.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is adapted by Frank Darabont from the novella ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King. There have been many adaptations of King's works (e.g., Stand By Me, Misery, The Green Mile, etc.) but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" outshines them all. Why? Because it is nothing short of outstanding.For those of you who don't know what Shawshank is about, it concerns a banker named Andy Dufresne - played by Tim Robbins - who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his philandering wife and her lover and sentenced to life imprisonment at Shawshank State Penitentiary. He becomes close friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), the film's narrator who has a reputation for being able to ""get things"" from the outside world for the other prisoners. He and Andy become the best of friends as the years go by, during which time Andy's financial knowhow becomes an asset to the prison guards, particularly the corrupt Warden, who uses Andy as an accomplice in his money-laundering operation.Shawshank explores themes of redemption and hope. Throughout his time in prison, Andy refuses to accept the hopelessness of his situation and maintains his integrity and self-worth, which ultimately pays off at the conclusion of the film. Likewise, Red finds redemption and solace through his friendship with Andy, by performing acts of common decency that, in turn, build his own sense of integrity, self-worth and hope.It is these themes that do not make Shawshank a great film but an excellent one. The visual style should be applauded, particularly Frank Darabont's direction and Roger Deakins' cinematography. While the characters communicate and interact freely, they are nonetheless trapped within the confines of the prison, accurately captured by the dark tone of the atmosphere that Deakins and Darabont create so well.The performances in this film are masterful. Tim Robbins' lead performance as Andy Dufresne is skillful and nuanced. Each line is delivered flawlessly, his body language and subtle facial expressions are perfect in capturing the character's calm, laconic yet hopeful demeanour. His performance surely merited an Oscar nomination and deserved more recognition than it had from major award ceremonies.The performance of Morgan Freeman is also one to be noted. His narration is superb, and he never fails to connect with the audience. Particularly in the last quarter of the film, Freeman gives solid proof of why he is one of the finest actors alive.The Shawshank Redemption is arguably the best movie of all time and deserved more recognition than it had. Held in high regards by critics and viewers everywhere, it serves as a testament to Frank Darabont's skill as a director and Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's skills as actors. It is surely to go down as one of the modern classics of filmmaking and is up there with ""The Godfather"", ""Citizen Kane"", ""Casablanca"" and ""Gone with the Wind."" One of the greatest achievements in cinema in recent times."
" A true masterpiece for any film-goer.
",,"'The Shawshank Redemption' is perhaps one of, if not the, perfect film. Every other ""great film"", or any film for that matter has it's pros and cons. Most motion pictures that are as well received as this have plenty going for it, very few against it. While I feel there are films out there with better pros; the pro to con ratio of 'The Shawshank Redemption' out-stands any other film film ever produced. I can't begin to describe every amazing element of this film. Obviously the performances are exquisite, the directing is exceptional and the score is extraordinary. The cinematography, in particular, struck me. Roger Deakins is a master with light and framing. I will watch this film again and again and remember it as one of the greatest films ever made. This film truly lies within the sweet spot of cinema."
" I thought I'd discovered this movie
",,"I'd never heard of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" when I tuned in to it about 15 minutes in on one of my satellite channels, sometime around 1997 or so.It mesmerized me, and the last 20 minutes astounded me. The twists, the musical score, the final scene. Amazing.I recall doing some searches (in those pre-Google days, probably with Alta Vista) to find out if anyone else had ever heard of this film. I found out that they had. It turns out a whole lot of people discovered this film as a ""sleeper,"" on DVD or cable or satellite.My favorite movies of around that time, seen in theaters, had been ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Heat."" I didn't see ""Forrest Gump"" until around 2000 or so, and didn't care for it much. A good year for films.Given the comments in the past half year or so (that I've gone back through), I suppose ""Shawshank"" will fall below some other films. There seems to be a a trend toward making ""Hey, it's not all that!"" (That is, it's not all that good, it's lousy, it's overrated, etc.)Whatever, it's a great film. And when I happened to see it late one night on my satellite system, I thought I was the first to realize how great it was. It took several years for me to spot the high ratings on IMDb and to read that it had become a cult classic favorite.(Ditto for ""The Big Lebowski,"" which for a while I thought I was the only fan of. Now it's a subject of festivals and midnight watchings, sort of like ""Rocky Horror"" once was. I saw ""Rocky Horror"" in 1976 at the World Science Fiction Convention in Kansas City and thought it was not very entertaining.)For me, the last 20-30 minutes is just the best. One twist after another, all seamlessly done. And a compelling musical score. Unforgettable."
" Salvation
",spoiler,"There are only a few movies that one will see in their lifetime that affects the course of your life. I have loved The Shawshank Redemption since I first saw it, but only recently had its powerful effect shown to me. In short order I lost my father to illness, my wife to separation, and my career to anger and dismay. Lost in depression, mired in pain, and alone in a large house I watched it again. Between Brooks suffering, Red's hatred of hope, and Andy's response to his final isolation, I stopped feeling alone. It is simple...get busy living or get busy dying. This movie gave me the strength to start over. The movie is popular for many reasons, but it has a healing power for people trapped in their own Shawshank."
" You'll get it when you see it.
",,"A very, very, very brilliant film. The acting is superb from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, as always. The script was amazing, along with the directing. The film is one of the best films ever made due to how original it is. And the reason it is original is because it is a prison film with heart. It makes you care about criminals. The score is also very good.It's an enthralling piece of cinema and just... Amazing. I'd recommend this film to anyone due to everyone relating to it. People like films were you are sympathetic towards a criminal, just look at A Clockwork Orange."
" awesome movie
",,awesome movie...the story is highlight and the way Tim Robbins acted is simply superb...one of my favorite movies...!!! I really loved all the characters of the movie and all the drama involved in it. this is one movie that took over my mind for many days. It created a stir worldwide and made me think that movie's can be made in this way also.so I suggest movie lovers to watch this movie and not to miss a single scene in this film.hats-off to the cast and crew of shaw shank redemption it is one hell of a movie which will be remembered at least for a century.lets hope we get to see more films like these and enjoy the drama and enthusiasm which was provided by this very film.
" Shawashank Redemption astonishes me !!!
",,"I've heard of this movie before i saw it, to be honest not a single disagree on the perfectness of the actors or the production or the story or the dialogue, man!!! when i saw it i agreed and supported it to the last very minute, its one of the best movies i ever watched and it really deserve to the 1st top movie in the American cinema's history ... I'd like to thank all the people who worked in or share in it, i give it up for their great effort that will last in every one's memory for his life time. I'm sorry for my weak expression as I am impressed and my words may fail me, I did my best to deliver what i think. Hope to see new production with this kind of quality and this kind of mastering in every single detail."
" Words are unable to talk about it!!!!
",,"2417th review!!!! Superb. Great. Masterpiece. Unforgettable. Excellent. Brilliant. No, no , no. I have been thinking for months to find a word that can describe the film. Nothing's found yet and , to be honest, I think nothing will be found forever. The movie can't be expressed by words. Words are unable to talk about it and I have nothing to say about this masterpiece. But I'm hopeful to be able one day to express my feelings about it because ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies"" When it come to the Shawshank Redemption, I prefer to remain silent because ""silence is full of unspoken words"""
" One of the best - of all time. Seriously.
",,"If there was such a thing as a perfect movie, this is it. Of course, for practical reasons, one cannot award a film ten stars out of ten, because of the endless stream of new work demanding scrutiny. I'd like also to start by quoting another well known film, which sums up my opinion nicely. 'In many ways, the work of a critic is easy- we risk very little, and thrive on negative criticism, which is amusing to write and to read. But the harsh truth of the matter is that the average piece of junk is probably more valuable than our criticism designating it so'. This could not be closer to the truth. When it comes down to the wire, critics risk everything in dishing out praise, for fear of being ridiculed themselves.There can be no such danger with The Shawshank Redemption. It is an eternal masterpiece, timeless and inspiring. I avoid being clichéd, when it is at all possible to do so, but The Shawshank Redemption is beautiful, masterfully acted, with just that right amount of tenderness. This is a tale of moral courage, and the everlasting fight for justice. As with other films of the genre, one can tell what will happen, of course, but when you watch this film, you will time and again be genuinely surprised, and maybe even shed a tear for the persistence and unquenchable thirst of the human spirit. One leaps for joy after watching this incredible film, at the knowledge that evil, in all senses of the word, can, and will never triumph.Turning an eye to the technical side of things, just for a moment, I can discern not one single badly executed shot. The Shawshank Redemption is well written, and, as I have said before, brilliantly acted. Characters that could be flat are all allowed to develop and flourish, and the film is even better for it. The film grabs our attention, right from the word go, with agitated shots of Andy looking like he IS going to kill his wife. And the soundtrack. Well, there isn't much to say; except that most of the music in this film is some of the most beautiful I have ever heard.This is a deeply satisfying, wonderful, brilliant, fantastic, soulful cinematic work. Watch it, if you haven't seen it, and if you have, you must agree that this excellent film will be an eternal classic. There are, of course, films that people will prefer, I myself am strongly attracted to Subway, a 1985 film by Luc Besson, but for pure facial and objective value, cinema does not get much better than this."
" Brilliant. Moved me in a way I never thought possible.
",spoiler,"Im not going to sit here and go into a deep explanation of what this film is about, because that has been thoroughly explained in many of the other reviews. What I will say is that The Shawshank Redemption is without any doubt the most amazing film ever written. The acting is tremendous, the story is original, and the movie itself has a deeper meaning to it. This movie is not about the hardships of prison, it is about the importance of friendship and the realization that hope is your greatest aspect. This piece does not focus as much on Andy and his great escape from Shawshank, but more on Red finding that there is always meaning and a purpose for everything. The story really unfolds when Brooks, an old timer that Andy and Red had been close friends with, is put on parole and released from prison. After confronting the outside world and knowing that he could not cope with it, Brooks finds that he has no purpose outside of life in jail and hangs himself. Later in the movie, after Andy makes his great escape from prison, Red is finally released from Shawshank himself, and is put in the same situation as Brooks. Only one reason marks the fact that Red himself didn't commit suicide. That reason is Andy. Red figures out that he does have a purpose outside of prison which is to see his best friend again and to ""give him a handshake"". And as the movie comes to a marvelous ending, that hope to see Andy becomes a reality.Overall the best movie I have ever watched and I am glad to say that I will continue to keep watching it again and again and again."
" Hope never gives up on you
",spoiler,"Belonging to the younger generation, I often wondered what all the fuss about this movie was all about. I am a big fan of action movies, I normally do not watch movies that have a slow storyline. Inception , I always thought, was my favourite. Then I one day decided to watch the Shawshank Redemption. I was moved to the core of my heart. The movie instantly became my all-time favourite. It proved to me that, no matter how dark the tunnel may seem, there is always a light burning at the end of it. Its never too late to give up on hope. It keeps you burning bright, in spite of the incessant and seemingly undeserved storms all around you, till the time life may finally turn around for you. For if your light is not burning till then, you will never make it to that moment. This is what this movie has taught me. If you are feeling down about anything in your life, this is the movie you always wanted to watch."
" Review of ""The Shawshank Redemption""
",,"What to say about the ""Shawshank Redemption""? I shouldn't really have to say anything because when most people hear about it, they already have a pretty good idea of how incredible it is. This movie is freakin' immaculate. Darabont and Co. have created not only the most inspiring film in ages, but one of the most emotionally significant films to date. The movie teaches things to us that we need to know - messages on hope, perseverance, and friendship - and it does it with marvelous eloquency. All in all, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" remains one of the most spectacular films I have ever seen - a master piece of art. Perfect."
" Hope!!!
",,"I watched this movie for the umpteenth time probably last Sunday and how much I loved it yet again!!! A movie I would never ever get bored of and definitely, one of my all time favorites. A simple yet wonderful story about HOPE!!! HOPE – One word that drives all of us and gives us reason to live. We push ourselves through our mundane lives in the hope of achieving / finding something that we dream of. In the words of this movie's protagonist – ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies""!!! Superlative performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.A must watch if you haven't!!!"
" Shawshank Redemption- Prison Film is Redeemed by Quality ****
",spoiler,"An outstanding film dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoners. Many social problems are discussed here. The picture earned a well-deserved best picture Oscar nomination. It certainly should have tied with the winner, the equally good ""Forrest Gump.""Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman etched unforgettable performances as prisoners charged with murder. The film shows what prison life is all about. Subjects dealing with prison survival, brutality, corruption and ultimate redemption are well shown.As the corrupt, insane warden invoking religion to justify his actions, Mr. Gunton gives a worthy performance.This is a film of rare power. James Whitmore was equally memorable as a prisoner who was unable to adjust to the outside after his parole following a 50 year stint. This shows that people who have been incarcerated for such a long period, need some sort of readjustment training before they rejoin society. For Whitmore, freedom meant ultimate doom.Politics is also depicted in a negative way in this gritty film. This is a memorable viewing experience for audiences."
" A gritty look at prison. One of the best prison movies ever.
",,"This movie I'm not going to call this film the IMDb #1 movie, but I really can't deny that this is fantastic. The cast, the score, the writing, and the power are all here in this film, and filled with strength. It's one of those movies that you will continue to think about even after the film is over. It is about a friendship, a life, an evil, and a hope. A hope that is considered in many ways to be bridge to insanity inside the prison walls. We see these people as years of time goes by. We see friendships grow, and topics change. It really puts you in the prison, and makes you feel what's like to behind those bars. You feel the friendship, the hope, the darkness, and the pure horror of it all.4 stars out of 4"
" This should be in everyone's permanent collection.
",,"I haven't seen too many movies that I would rate a 10, but I had no problems giving this one top score.Movie-making seems to be like golf; for a truly excellent game, ALL the elements must come together. Everyone involved must have perfect ""form"". Director, Darabont, must have been at the top of his game when he put this gem together. Of course the actors were excellent; Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins seldom disappoint. The thing that makes this movie exceptional is that Darabont coaxed the best performances out of the supporting actors also. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown were utterly believable (and bad guys don't come much worse than them).The other essential ingredient for a successful movie is simple: It must have a well thought out plot with a perfect beginning, middle and end. So many movies fall over by getting at least one of these aspects wrong. Not so with Shawshank Redemption. Just like Goldilocks said, ""This is just right!"" Buy this one for your home collection because you'll definitely want to see it again."
" This movie is for every man
",,"There are few movies that capture and identify with the American male spirit. Shawshank is one of those movies. I don't care what anyone's take is on prison treatment or whether you are conservative or liberal, this movie is moving. There are three movies, in my opinion, that every man, or developing man, should watch: Shawshank Redemption, Dancing With Wolves, and Brave Heart. Unless you are a total pansy, these are the movies that will confirm your heterosexuality. Andy Dufrane is the person in us. Red is the person we want to be. Aside from the being in prison, the job they have is well apt to the people of this great nation."
" Redemption
",spoiler,"This movie is poetry. For those of you who've ever felt the way poetry rolls off of the tongue, you'll understand what I mean when I say this.The first thing that makes this movie great is Morgan Freeman's ability to narrate the way he does. His soft, yet ruff voice provides the audience with the belief that this man has endured many years of hardships and has gained wisdom and experience through trial and error. He is a natural story teller, so his ability as a narrator is natural and smooth; not forced, like so many other actors.Tim Robbins displays his acting ability beautifully and captures the audience with an intense amount of emotion, which seems to resonate in his eyes. The genius and wisdom of the character he portrays is a fascinating thing to watch unfold, as the story lays itself out, like a poster of Rita Hayworth.To say that this movie gives the audience hope would be unfair because this movie makes the audience want to live, love, experience life for all of its pleasures and its faults. It makes one appreciate the simple things and slow down a bit, to admire that which we pass a hundred times a day, but never truly see.To describe this movie as ""great"" would be an understatement because it is so much more than that. While it is brutal and realistic, it portrays humanity at our best and our worst, providing the audience with a mirror in which to reflect what lies within. By the time the credits roll, we're left speechless...and at the same time, wanting to share this masterpiece with those we love and cherish.Everyone should see this movie at least once in a lifetime to make us appreciate everything we have. Who would have thought someone could capture humanity this way? I guess a picture really is worth a thousand words......"
" #2086
",,"Don't know how many will ever see the 2,086th comment in this site - but just saw a friend's DVD of this film, again. I had missed it due to being in Europe on an extended business trip when it played first-run, and caught some portions of it a few years later, and then completely sometime following.This was the third or fourth time I'd seen it straight through, and it is one of those very rare films which is as good - maybe even better - on successive viewings.Robbins, Freeman, Gunton, and all of the remaining cast - whether in larger supporting roles or smaller - are outstanding, without a single exception.My friend is a computer whiz, with an IQ of probably 150, and widely-expert expert in this area. But he's so immersed in this realm, that whenever forced to use pen and paper (instead of mouse or keyboard) he does so on about the 5th-grade level. After the film (he had bought the DVD, but had never seen it before) he stated he didn't feel the Robbins character could have pulled-off all the shenanigans with the money, from prison via mail (and perhaps sometimes using a messenger of the warden's) the way the film depicted -- whereas today, if such an inmate had a computer terminal available, it would be more possible.I told him I felt certain the opposite was true. In the era of the story, a very intelligent financially-adept individual - especially a former whiz-kid bank V.P. - could have done what was shown even more effectively and successfully than via computer today, with all the firewalls, and in-house computer nerds any bank has. Someone with both tremendous financial and hacker ability might - but not as easily as Tim did, during a period when signatures and figures on paper and the like were the governing elements.This aspect is one of the most critical and climactic for the story and its very satisfying ending. And Gunton, a tremendous actor who has done many sympathetic characters, presents one of the best performances portraying a truly evil person - more so for the quieter and ""nasty-nice"" elements of this portrayal. He juxtaposes quiet demeanor, often even pious, with completely selfish, vicious, amoral actions, as well as humanly possible, with his performance in this roleThis is a film for which the term ""perfect piece of entertainment"" does not exaggerate."
" Greatest Movie of All time, hands down!
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is the BEST movie of all time for many reasons. The first reason being that Morgan Freeman did his best acting job, and that is saying something. Freeman is the greatest actor of all time. Secondly, Tim Robbins gets so into his part you feel like the story is totally true and you are actually seeing it first hand. The supporting actors are wonderful as well. Enough about the acting which was second to none but the story was so compelling. The audience feels sympathy for the main character and wishes for him to be redeemed, in the end its just a feel good story. I cannot express this enough, GO WATCH THE MOVIE NOW! It is awesome and will never be topped."
" great film
",,I can watch this film a hundred times and still enjoy it. Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors. And this must be his best roll ever. I thought Tim Robbins was definitely at his best in this film. All the prison guards and inmates were really believable. The story captures you from the beginning and doesn't let go until the final credits are rolled. This is the kind of film that make you think of how many inequities must exist in our prison system that no one ever hears about. Of all the the movies of this type the Shawshank Redemtion brings to light how good and evil can exist in every situation. And that nothing is black and white. But until it effect you its out of sight and out of mind.
" One of the best movies I've ever seen
",,"This movie takes you through the life of some inmates of Shawshank prison. A very moving story.One of the best stories I've had the pleasure of seeing in a long time.Normally, I don't go out for these types of movies (sci-fi/classic horror fan). This one really surprised me. I actually didn't see it in the theater, but caught it on TV, then rented the movie. I've since bought it and have actually watched it a few times, which is rare for me to do. I usually watch a movie once, then not again for at least 6 months to a year.This movie will one day be a classic in my mind.Enjoy!"
" Credit where credit is due.
",,"This film is, love it or hate it, flawless. I find myself unable to pick out any one element of this movie that was poorly executed or inconsistent. The Director, Frank Darabont, despite his much-less-than-impressive filmography successfully animates every scene and character in living detail. Whats more is the life and detail he brought to his screenplay.Originally published under Richard Bachman, Stephen King's once-pseudonym, ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" is one of the most miserable short stories ever hacked out by any desperately uninspired fiction author in history. The book makes no attempt to build or define characters, background, or story progression. It basically apexes around the one scene in the prison theatre where the writer clumsily tries to convey the point of the book: as hopeless as a man's situation is, his dreams and fantasies live on. After King's catharsis he seemingly looses any real interest in his story and apathetically caps it off several pages later.Frank Darabont not only masterfully directed this film but deserves much more credit for crafting 95% of this movie purely from his own imagination and being able to construct a very tangible plot line from complete tripe. Credit where credit's due, Stephen King doesn't even deserve royalties."
" A Masterpiece
",,"For it's subtlety, it's intelligence, and it's gorgeous cinematography (often overlooked in this film), this is one of the finest films ever made. Robbins and Freeman are brilliant. The rest of the cast flows through the storyline with a poise and cadence that is flawless. The story itself is based on a short work by Stephen King, but the screenplay is sculpted perfectly and gently into a full-length film by Frank Darabont. A powerful story of one man's journey through a punishment he did not deserve, and ""redemption"" of soul that lifts the hearts of viewers. It reminds us that ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things"". Gentle and supremely smart."
" Incredibly moving, funny and haunting
",,"Where to begin on how to comment on one of the most beautiful, haunting, tragic yet slightly comical films in creation? This film is absolutely groundbreaking and deserves its place amongst all the greats of Cinema History. Complete with an amazing cast, a wonderful soundtrack and a storyline that will leave you mesmerised for years after your first viewing, this film is truly incredible.The film focuses on a man called Andy Dufresne, an intelligent banker who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover, and is consequentially sentenced to two life sentences in Shawshank Prison. Andy soon befriends a man named Red, a man imprisoned for murder, and runs an underground syndicate to help his friends get a hold of things from outside prison.Andy manages to help the guards of Shawshank Prison with their personal financial problems using his knowledge as a Banker, and an unlikely 'friendship' emerges, and soon Prison life doesn't seem so bleak for Andy. As Andy's journey through his life sentence grows, so does his friendship with Red, and he soon discovers what effects the walls of Shawshank have on the people in the prison after a series of unexpected and tragic events.Andy's personality soon earns him new friends as he begins to change people, fundamentally, without knowing how, as he spreads new lessons, both comically and psychologically, and soon Andy turns into a much more intelligent man than we may have realised him to be at first.As time goes on, Andy resolves to make Shawshank Prison friendlier and he works relentlessly to improve life for the prisoners and for the guards. But, as he continues to work hard for the good of others, he begins to learn the shocking truths of what the true colours of the guards and the Warden of Shawshank are. Revelations all come to the fore when Andy discovers some information which may prove him to be the innocent guy he has always claimed to be, and Andy's life takes a serious turn, and the consequences are dire for everybody as Andy's decisions become more and more unpredictable.Based on a short book by Stephen King, this film has hardly any faults at all, and is full of beauty, tragedy and comedy, and has a haunting presence as Morgan Freeman gives what is possibly the best performance he has ever given, and Tim Robbins excels as the tormented Andy. But, what makes this film go down in history isn't just the amazing script and the wonderful acting, but the film contains one of the most beautiful Soundtracks I have ever known, written by Thomas Newman. Many of the tunes are simplistic, yet very memorable, and they all perfectly reflect the dilemmas and situations the characters of the film find themselves in.This film is not afraid to shock people with its subtle shifts in the personalities of characters, and how a situation of comedy and hope may suddenly change to a tragedy beyond what you may have originally expected. This film is a true classic. This is a work of art which is endlessly re-experiencable with painful pleasure."
" One of the Greatest Ever
",,"After watching this movie i was stunned at how great it was. It was the first movie that kept me hooked the whole way through and had everything in it. What made it better was seeing how it was expanded so well from the original short story, which again was very good. How anyone can say it less, must not have been watching it properly. There is nothing to say to criticise the movie, the acting was brilliant, the casting great, and the directing, breath taking. But we can not overlook the great writer who brought this story to life, Steven King. Without having writers like him, we would never have any movies to match up to the likes of Shawshank and Godfather. I am still waiting for another movie to knock it off the top of my top 10 list, however, i am doubtful if this will ever happen."
" A kind-hearted masterpiece of friendship...
",spoiler,"This majestic movie is about Andy (Tim Robbins), a banker wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover after discovering she had been cheating on him. He gets impounded with two life sentences in the Shawshank Prison. There he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) who befriends him, and as the story moves along slowly, he eventually understands what Andy once told him: ""Get busy living, or get busy dying.""Andy is persistent in his quest to be free. And he tries to convince Red during the entire course of the movie that hope is indeed a good thing, even in a prison like Shawshank. In his endeavor, Andy will come face to face with the warden, who is truly a manifestation of greed itself. Many challenges will test his mettle.This piece of art is not to be missed; it is one of the greatest works of modern drama. And the slow pace of the movie only helps further to sink you in its mood, and leave you satisfied with a strange bitter sweet feeling in the end."
" One of my TOP TEN
",,"I saw (once again) last night ""Shawshank Redemption"". If I have seen it once, I have seen it fifty times and never does it ever get tiring to me. Stephen King wrote a story which becomes one of the great classic movies of all time. ""Shawshank"" is a story of a wronged man who overcomes the injustices of life, love and prison to remain the true person he always was. Andy, although a solitary and enigmatic person, finds himself through an injustice which throws him into a quagmire of human refuse. In this refuse he finds a few pieces of humanity which lets him know there is hope. Red is one of those humans. Upon realizing that he is about to fall into the hell of prison obscurity, Andy releases himself and escapes from the injustice of his current ""human"" existence. I use the word EXISTENCE for the whole movie is a work of existential survival. This is a movie that NO ONE should miss."
" Hope is everything
",,"This movie surprised me so much I watched it twice in one day the first time I saw it. Sure I hadn't just picked a movie at random, at the local DVD-shop, but I didn't expect it to be so good. After I watched it I had a look on the IMDb website and was surprised once again that i found it placed number 2 on the top 250 movies list. I wondered to myself, why didn't I know about this movie. Afterall Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are quite well-known actors. Frank Darabont however only just caught my attention in 1999, when 'the Green Mile' was released. Finally I came to the conclusion that it must have been either television, because it surely isn't on television often enough, or it could just be me, not knowing very much about the film-world before 1995. For in fact, everyone in my school seemed to have known 'the Shawshank Redemption' for a very long time. ""One of the best movies ever"", my best friend said, ""My favorite movie in the whole wide world"", another one of my friends. THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME!!!! I replied. If you liked 'the Green Mile', I'm telling you now, you'll love this!!!"
" One of the Best If You Get It
",,"People look for all sorts of things in movies, and you can see it in the occasional negative review that pops up for this movie.  Some viewers are looking for gritty realism in everything on the screen.  Others are action junkies.  Still others perhaps take film too seriously and reduce moviemaking to nothing more than a game of who can come up with the edgiest shot, or the niftiest angle.  For all of these, there is the very real chance that they simply will not ""get"" this film, and that's too bad -- they are missing out on a classic.At its best, film can transcend merely being a series of pictures, no matter how pretty, and can reach down and touch people.  That is where Shawshank succeeds so brilliantly.  It is not the fastest moving movie, not the edgiest, not the grittiest, it is filmed in shades of gray.  But this movie absolutely sings with human spirit, and captures an universal human theme as well as any movie has ever done.  And THAT is filmmaking at its finest.  Not a game, not eye candy -- this movie stays with you long after the credits have rolled."
" Extraordinary
",,"An analysis of prison life--and of what hope can be in a prison--Frank Darabont's first film is one of the best ever.  Well-written and well-acted, the story of the development of friendship between Red and Andy is charming, endearing, poignant.  Nothing about this movie is overwrought or extraneous--it's simply extraordinary drama."
" As succinct as I can be
",,"Occasionally you go into a cinema and all the films you wanted to see were full. As you've come this far and you're a bit of a film fan you go to see a film you've heard nothing about. I did this 6 years ago, with expectations low and a boredom threshold to match I sat and waited to be disappointed. 2 hours later I walked out of the cinema a different person, before I had not been moved by a film, I didn't care if : Indiana Jones made it, Sonny Corleone got wacked, Fred married Ginger, ET got home. Before, films were either plot driven or character driven, they were action or comedy, sad or happy, a few came along that combined a number of facets that I enjoyed, respected  or challenged how I viewed an issue or a person.Shawshank was different, there were characters I believed, not just one or two but virtually all. Throughout the first hour I was gripped the full range of emotions were explored, the second hour building on the characters was even more powerful, some characters came and went but ultimately this was a story of 2 people: Red and Andy. I have never seen a film that so eloquently and beautifully illustrates friendship and hope.This has become the benchmark by which I judge all movies. I am pleased that I am not alone in feeling this way. I am glad that it did not win oscars as I feel individual endorsement is stronger than any vested interest award ceremony, I relish telling everyone this is my favourite film. I have seen it many times and will see it many more."
" Interpersonal Communication Use
",,"I use this movie in my Interpersonal Communication course.  The relationship between Red and Andy provides rich examples for my students to look for as they write on important issues of Interpersonal Communication such as the symbolic nature of language, powerful and powerless speech, posture, intimate and social distances, territory, chronemics, various types of listening, and self disclosure.  Many ""young"" students struggle to relate ""in-class/in-text"" examples to their own lives, and I use this movie to give the class a common experience to discuss and better understand the foundational elements of Interpersonal Communication.  ALWAYS a good experience for my students!"

" To be seen once every 6 months, for complete revitalisation of Mind and Soul
",,"Like a beautifully crafted French wine, this movie keeps getting better and better with every passing year. Every time I have viewed it over the past decade (and it must be at least more than 20 times by now), I have found newer shades, subtler indications, and deeper meanings. And it has amazed me like very few have.* No overacting * Humour in the drab hopeless environs of Shawshank * Method in the madness of running the scams from inside * The complete secrecy maintained for 20 years (not even Red knew!) * The best that a highly-educated intellectual could do inside such a prison * What a great actor the Warden turned out to be - totally despicable! * What a bunch of speakable quotes.. what a bunch! * Totally recommended for any young person - students especially * HOPE TRULY IS THE BEST OF THINGS - a message that shines through"
" Best movie ever
",,"I'm a 290 pound, mean-looking dude, but I cried like a baby watching this movie.This is a masterpiece in American story telling.Every scene builds up the tension.Every dialog adds depth.Every central character makes sense.The ending makes you smile.Tim Robbins' and Morgan Freemans acting is simply outstanding. Throughout the movie, you feel you get to know their inner thoughts, their longings, their fears. FANTASTIC! MARVELOUS! INGENIOUS!"
" A Powerful Story of Courage, Perseverance and Friendship ...
",,"I will never forget the first time I watched ""The Shawshank Redemption"", with my father. Both of us were fans of prison and male-bonding movies, and choose the film only expecting to watch a solid drama. Needless to say that, when the last line was delivered and the TV screen painted the walls with a beautiful blue, the feeling that we had just watched something exceptional instantly cut through our hearts, and before the second viewing, we would regularly mention how great that film ""with the poster"" was.Then I would never miss it whenever I found it on TV, and after each viewing, it unveiled one unsuspected element of its unique appeal. I guess if it doesn't justify, at least it explains why this movie that didn't do well in the theaters, had a better success on VHS, TV and DVD before it would ultimately dethrone ""The Godfather"" from the first place on IMDb Top 250. And it's only justice if ""The Shawshank Redemption"", the least spectacular of the four Best Picture nominees in the glorious 1994, made by a relatively unknown director, a movie with an appeasing and appealing patience, took its time to grow on people and did it pretty well, as if it applied its own philosophy, patiently but determinedly. This is the strength of ""The Shawshank Redemption"", its ability to tell a story that spans a long period of time without trying to get to the so-called essential, the simplest things take their full meanings, the smallest details have their share of importance. And think about it, in a prison where everyone wears the same outfits, where the days are regulated by the same routine, all you can do is to make a life out of this routine, make a place, to get closer to your own definition of 'having a life'. And as we penetrate the impressive walls of Shawshank, from the first vertiginous panoramic shot, we're literally submerged by the solemn austerity of the location, conveying a very hostile feel. These characteristics are perfectly incarnated by the figure of the Warden Samuel Norton, who's like the male alter-ego of Nurse Ratched from ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". And the comparison with Forman's film isn't fortuitous as Shawshank intends to domesticate its occupants to the same limits of mechanical alienation, to the point that the only thing left to the inmates is to control their only valuable treasure: time, by getting busy, finding their own reason-to-be, like the veteran Brooks (James Whitmore) was the man with the books, Red, remarkably played by Morgan Freeman, was the man who could get you things.In a very intelligent move from the script, the hero of the film, the laconic Andy Dufresne, an upper-class banker, played in all nuance by Tim Robbins, is condemned to a life sentence at Shawshank, for the murder of his wife and her lover. And nothing indicates if he is innocent or guilty and I wondered if any certitude would have conditioned my appreciation of the character. I think it was necessary for us to have a reasonable doubt about his innocence in order to let his character progressively grow on us until we believe by ourselves that he was indeed the victim of unfortunate circumstances, the same feeling that grew in the heart of Red before becoming his best friend. Morgan Freeman is the pillar of the film while Tim Robbins is its free spirit, both allow us in a remarkable complementarity to dream of abstract notions like hope and freedom while being practical and 'busy' in the same time. And again, their friendship is a slow process that takes its time to progress and reaches a pivotal point when Andy was allowed to put his banker's casket again and feels that prison didn't deprive him from his 'social quality'. Shawshank is not slow but more a patience-demanding film with a sense of decency in the way it trusts our intelligence. And the film's motto, on which relies its philosophical core is ""Get busy living or get busy dying"". Now, two things occur to me while writing these lines, a heart-breaking sequence about the inmate Brooks who was freed after 50 years of detention, and who realized he was institutionalized. A notion explained by Red: when the infamous wall that scared you so much becomes your personal guiding light while outside, it's all dark and your time is deconstructed. Brooks couldn't live outside Shawshank so there was no other way he could live. The second thing is the sad passing of Steve Jobs today. And as I was reading his famous Stanford speech, I couldn't help but make a connection with the beautiful message of Darabont's film, an invitation to dream, to escape from any sort of walls or obstacles put in your life and heart with as many dreams as you can fulfill, a notion illustrated by the beautiful scene when Andy put some classical music on the microphone, so the prisoners could for once elevate themselves and having an ephemeral moment of pure freedom, this is the triumph of human spirit, this understanding of the value of life is ""The Shawshank Redemption""In the same vein than ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Shawshank"" is a constant encouragement to fight the system and use time for the best, for whatever constitutes our dreams, being men again, able to enjoy, to feel, to give a meaning to our lives. In other words, hope, hope that things can get better despite the adversity. To quote Steve Jobs : ""Courage is the discovery that you may not win, and trying when you know you can lose."" This is the true intelligence of life, what makes it worth living.""The Shawshank Redemption"" a powerful adaptation of Stephen King's novel is one of the greatest American films: a powerful story of courage, perseverance, hope and ultimately, friendship and humanity."
" An excellent film contained within a classic
",,"When I first saw the Shawshank Redemption, I was in a movie theater on a week night at around 11pm. I had gotten out of work from working the evening shift. I was tired and just wanted a little amusement. This was at a time after Shawshank had been released but got little attention. I had heard some Oscar buzz so my curiosity got the better of me. I half reluctantly chose to watch it. That night, I was not prepared to be blown away. I didn't see a movie, I was transported by a story. I was instantly transcended into realizing why films should be made to begin with. I wasn't just entertained, I was emotionally moved and intellectually bamboozled in the most endearing manner. If this film remains on IMDb's number one spot for a long time to come, It's well deserves it. To me personally, the Shawshank Redemption is a testament as to why the 90's were an interesting decade but more than that, why a film can become an experience and gain instant classic status. There are two simple rules you should follow prior to watching T S R: one, if you haven't seen it, don't let any one who HAS seen it tell you anything about its plot, Don't listen to a word caus they might ruin it for you. Two, make arrangements not to be interrupted when watching the film; no phone calls, no door bells, no other plans. Watch it from beginning to end. You can't over hype this film it's just that good. What i've written here is just a small fraction of what I can further express by way of praise for the film. Long live The Shawshank Redemption on IMDb !"
" ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies""
",,"I have grown up watching Bollywood movies, full of overacting by overpaid, overfed 'heroes'. It was in college that i got to see some fine Hollywood films and this one was probably the finest of the lot. This film at first appears to be a story about life in prison. It fully describes every small experience of a person serving a long prison sentence. Life is not easy there for a lot of reasons. The screenplay is ably supported by Morgan Freeman's brilliant narration offering a second-person view of life in shawshank. But Tim Robbins steals the show by aptly underplaying the part of a wrongly sentenced, wealthy banker.The last forty minutes of this film, however, help raise it a couple of levels above other cinematic masterpieces. You don't need a weapon to fight. It is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope."
" Redemptive Masterpiece; Masterful Redemption
",,"Despair or determination; crying or fighting; obedience or inner freedom; resignation or patience; fear or hope...difficult choices in life make us all more powerful human beings. Experience makes us richer; hardship makes us stronger, friendship makes us better. Although we may be deprived of everything, only our own choices may truly deprive us of human dignity... These words ring the bell for the majority of people; yet, seldom do they appear so unique, so real and so concrete as in this wonderful film...Based on the novella by Stephen King RITA HAYWORTH AND SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, the story appears to be unlike any other movie, unlike any other adaptation of Stephen King's stories onto screen, unlike most productions of the world cinema. Why? I think that every viewer has to answer this question oneself. What I am going to do in this review is not look at why it is so powerful, why it is so unique but rather focus on a certain aspect that, in a way, refers to this question. What absorbed me to the very core of my emotions and feelings is the main plot of Andy (Tim Robbins), the banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to Shawshank prison where brutality and wretchedness really reign. At the spot where for many people, life actually ends, for Andy a new tedious struggle begins. Quickly befriended by ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), actually the narrator of the story, both soon prove that even in the worst circumstances, within the ""hell on earth"" they can maintain human dignity and strive on their own way to freedom...Here, let me refer to Roger Ebert's words who nicely described the character of Andy: he says that ""Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him."" Indeed, salvation lies within discipline for him...self-discipline...Except for some other plots, including the touching yet tragic story of Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) and of the sympathetic librarian Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), it is Andy and Red who supply us with the most unforgettable moments in the movie. It is, as a matter of fact, the story of their friendship, their dreams expressed at the wall of despair. They maintain hope around themselves and within the viewers. Here, a very powerful aspect of Red is his narration...our thoughts are directed towards his thoughts, towards his reflections and his perception of the events, his - the prisoner's. Swear words take on power to convey meanings and harshness becomes reality. Here, it is important to mention the inevitable brutality in the film. Thanks to the fact it is perceived by Red, it never appears to be unendurable or harmful for the emotions of the viewer. We, as observers, truly know what world we are led to...yet, there is no loss of hope!The unforgettable scenes seem to evoke the most powerful associations and expectations that lie within us concerning the visual and sensual experience. With Thomas Newman's terrific music score consisting of dark piano music, we are supplied with intense emotions and effective thrill. Except for the symbolic and almost cult scene when Andy escapes the prison (mind you the almost claustrophobic effect), one cannot skip ""The Letter Duet"" scene when the excerpt of Mozart's ""The Marriage of Figaro"" is being played. The prison life stops for a while being awestruck by the glimpse of harmony, by the blissful moment of magnificence. At this moment, I was breathless and really second the powerful line: ""Music makes you free!"" The performances are awesome and the depiction of characters is executed in an extraordinary way. There are no clichés which is a great merit of the film and where many films of the genre fall into that trap. Although there were many actors who had been cast for the role of Red, I think that no one would have done the job as well as Morgan Freeman. He is perfect in the role combining a certain quality of patience and distance with the emotional struggle for personal rights. Ironically, he portrays a re-socialized character...in fact, richer inside than any ""corrupted decency."" Tim Robbins also does a terrific job as Andy with all his features mentioned before. And Bob Gunton as a true villain, the boss of this hell of Shawshank will long remain in memory.To sum it up, I agree with short but meaningful words said by Roger Ebert: ""THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a movie about time, patience and harmony..."" I would even add that it is the film about true life where people are really themselves, to the most extent themselves. There, within the harshest reality... Because only there, we truly behave according to our rules. There, we make choices even if everything that surrounds us seems to yell: ""Salvation lies within blind discipline and fundamental Bible!"" A redemptive masterpiece, a masterful redemption...desperate Brooks was here...and so was Red...yet, he brought a new dawn for dreams, a new dawn for friendship... Will he succeed?"
" A fantastic story which touches the inner-most of the body
",,"I felt a sudden need to create an account on the web. Why? I do not know. Having never written any movie review, I sometime wonder why I felt a need to use a regular Friday night doing so. But then I ask myself: Do there really have to be a purpose? Maybe not.The first time I watched The Shawshank Redemption were a couple of years ago. I had looked up the evening's TV program and I stumbled across the movie title. Not really expecting anything out from the film's summary, I sat down on this evening and watched it. And did it move me. I was completely blown away by everything which the film contained: The acting, the environment, the music - and the story. The ladder plays an important role in the movie. Why? Because in short, the film is about a man who is wrongfully charged for murder, and the next many years in which he spends inside prison. But there is something more to it. The story is so well polished, constructed and so well told, that you wonder about what was done in the process of creating the movie, which could have made it so moving and so heart-touching. Because really, it is all the details and the finesse of the movie, which takes the film to a higher level than any other film which are told through storytelling.Throughout the 130 minutes of the film, you will be witness to fantastic all around acting, particularly from Morgan Freeman who does a hell of a job working as the story teller. With the film starting out slowly, it smoothly starts to work towards the second half of the film, where the film really starts to touch your soul. The ending of the Shawshank Redemption is one of the best on film ever made, I dare say that.I could continue endlessly naming the goods of the film, but there is simply too much. In the end it is hard to point out what makes the Shawshank Redemption so much better than everything else which you have ever seen. My advice is: Buy the film and watch it - you will not be disappointed.I hope..."
" Best film I have ever seen
",spoiler,"I don't write film reviews normally, but this is no normal film. i never tire of watching the Shawshank redemption not because of its sheer brilliance but because of all the intertwining emotions portrayed by the characters.The film begins slowly but Andy Dufresene (Tim Robbins) has a strange, intriguing style unfamiliar with that of a normal inmate jailed for 2 life sentences. As the film progresses it's almost like you know the characters and you're part of the gang with Andy and Red. you feel andy's tenacity as he battles for whats right. As you begin to relate to Andy's feelings you are reminded why he is there: found guilty of murdering his wife and her lover. So when the 'new boy' clears his name there is a huge relief, almost like a maternal feeling of 'i knew it' As the film builds towards the end you cannot know what is about to happen and when it does.... wow; brilliant ending. brilliant film"
" Very powerful
",,"I feel sorry for all of you , guys/girls who rated this as 1 star (awful). I really do not think you could consider this as the worst or one of the worst movies you have ever seen. Maybe it is overrated, maybe not , but STOP trying to lower its position in the Top 250. This is supposed to be a USER RATING , so if you loved it , give it a 10 , if for you it is an average movie , give it a 5. I read some comments about this one , and heard someone saying : "" ... it is a good movie, deserves 6 or 7 stars , but i gave it 1 star because I think it is very overrated ... "" That's so pathetic ...Once again , STOP doing this and rate the movie as you liked it !"
" Must watch movie!!!!
",,Shawshank Redemption!!!! First time when I heard this name I had no idea what Shawshank is all about. I must accept the fact that I was not fascinated by its name but luckily I managed to see this movie. This movie is awesome it will fill you with hope when you start loosing hope at some point of time in your life. That's the power of this movie. I have seen this movie maximum number of times as I have not seen others. Story goes this way:A man who was wrongly convicted murder of his wife and her lover. He got two life sentences back to back. He felt that he might not be proved good husband but he was not a murderer so he started planning to dig the tunnel to be free from this. The way he dig the tunnel and the person who helped him in his project was the crux of this movie. So it was his hope that was kept deep inside his heart that provide such a power to escape from the Shawshank.Please rent the DVD and watch it. you will surely find it most amazing movie as you have ever witness.
" phenomenal Film 11 out of 10
",,"This is one of those films that come once in a blue moon. The ones that leave you sitting on your seat staring at the screen when the film is ended and trying to think of a word to describe the excellence of the film Although Shawshank does take a while to get started, but you understand why later on the film. The characters need to be explained for you to understand later points in the film. What really makes this film great is the use of no special effects, no stunts, just plain simple amazingly original,witty story writing and outstanding acting by every character in the film including the minor ones. Just based in a prison, men talking to each other. This film does make you feel involved in the film. You feel every characters emotions and pain and share their joy and happiness. When the film ends it takes you 10 seconds to get back to reality again - its just that compellingBest personal Film of all time and best film on IMDb and rightly so Spectacular Film !"
" An epic movie of pure brilliance!
",,"This film is a truly awesome film once i had started watching the first 10 minutes of it i was addicted to the TV and could do nothing but to watch it. This story is about a respectable banker (Andy Duframe) who is sentenced to Shawshank prison for life imprisonment for a crime he did not commit. Once he arrives at Shawshank he soon starts to learn that the prison mentally takes your life. However, Andy seems very unusual being very quite and polite around the prison. At the spectacular climax at the end of this film it just gives the viewer such an amazing feeling of hope and in my opinion this is the best film every made. A must watch film!!! 10/10"
" Shamelessly uplifting; a heartfelt classic
",,"It was the film that never seemed to have a break cut out for it. Adapted from a Steven King short story (usually a sure sign of success), yet a disappointment at the box office. Nominated for seven Oscars, yet emerging with no wins. But, hope sprung eternal, and, as life began to imitate art, like its central characters, the film The Shawshank Redemption overcame such initial adversity to become one of the most revered and cherished films of all time. Director/screenwriter Frank Darabont, working from Steven King's short story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' brings the tale to life in a superbly powerful and emotionally flooring fashion. Darabont's script executes the incredibly difficult task of speaking directly to the human spirit, with its tale of passion and dedication overcoming captivity and adversity. Few modern films are bold enough to tackle such shamelessly inspirational themes as Shawshank's without coming across as painfully clichéd, but Darabont's airtight script, chock full of timeless lines, and steady, careful directing are enough to raise the film above such concerns, instead marking a film of which the emotional magnitude is seldom paralleled. From Roger Deakins' sweeping, operatic cinematography, to Thomas Newman's truly beautiful and inspiring musical score, to the dank, gritty realism of Shawshank prison itself, the film's consistent quality on all fronts is truly stunning. It is easy to see a story such as this easily falling flat with an inferior cast taking on the material, but Darabont's incredibly gifted and memorable cast is truly up to the challenge, taking a wonderful story and making it truly timeless. Tim Robbins truly brings unconventional convict Andy Dufresne to life, never without a passionate twinkle in his eye, even in his most beaten down and hopeless of scenes. Rather than typical leading man grandstanding, Robbins is wise enough to remain subtle and detached throughout, making the role all the more mysterious and endearing as a result. The inspired casting of Morgan Freeman as fellow inmate 'Red' resulted not only in a series of sumptuous voiceovers by one of the most melodious voices in Hollywood, but also in a genuinely heartwarming supporting character, with Freeman building a career of playing similar 'wise mentor figures' off his performance. The supporting cast being comprised mainly of relative unknowns strengthens the believability of their characters, leading the audience to see them as their character and not as the star behind the role. Bob Gunton is chillingly effective as the hate-inspiring prison warden, infusing more menace into his reedy voice and deadpan stare than any scenery chewing antagonist could capture. Character actor Clancy Brown also crafts another simple but effective antagonistic role as the captain of the guards. Gil Bellows is a strong presence as a rebellious inmate, and James Whitmore is charming and lovable as aged prison librarian Brooks. Overall, The Shawshank Redemption is an astonishing accomplishment, addressing shamelessly uplifting themes in a fashion which is sentimental, but never sappy, larger than life, but never melodramatic. In many ways the film feels like a throwback to the days of classic cinema where directors strove to make films which made their audiences happy, but Darabont easily dodges contemporary scorn by unabashedly and honestly pitching the film towards the human spirit, and firmly establishing it as a timeless classic with its impeccable package of flooring technical work, screen writing and acting. Far from being a simple ""prison drama"", the sheer emotional voyage of The Shawshank Redemption is enough to drain any viewer, both crushing their spirits then euphorically raising them in a truly peerless fashion. While Red may declare hope to be a dangerous thing, it's Darabont's fearless tackling of the tricky subject which really sets Shawshank free. -10/10"
" Fantastic...
",spoiler,"The Shawshank Redemption has you hooked from the very first scene. Although Andy's innocence was obvious from the beginning, you just think how he's going to get out of it.For me, the power and depth in this movie was it's ability to make prison life and friendships look better than that on the outside. Also when they were finally released they were so hesitant to live on the outside and wanted to go back in. I'm not sure why this affected me so much but i think it's just the fact that one mistake forced these people to live in a certain way where they don't want so much freedom and they're used to being workers with no rewards. They just couldn't adapt to the outside world. As if it were a different planet or something.Although the men are supposed to be 'cold hearted killers', they seem so nice and are so easy to sympathise with. I know it sounds lame to feel sorry for a killer or thief but i think that the amazing story and acting, had me hoping that all of the prisoners were innocent... except for some obviously. Not to mention the guards were so mean and rude i just wished they would all get punished and tortured at the end of the movie.If someone can feel that passionate and involved in a movie the first time they've seen it...i think it's a sign that if the person reading this still hasn't...they should. The Shawshank Redemption most definitely deserves its spot on the IMDb top #250."
" When they give you life, that's what they take
",,"Out of the fertile mind of American author Steven King, comes the incredible prison story called ""The Shawshank Redemption."" It is the story of a young banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Sent to the notorious Shawshank, Dufresne, is subjected to the standard abuses every prisoner faces. During the ensuing years however, he is further subjected to additional punishment by the ""Sisters"" who enjoy torturing what they call 'fresh fish.' Still Andy tries to survive each day of his sentence as best he can. Being extremely agile at his banking craft, he overhears Captain Byron T. Hadley (Clancy Brown) complain of his personal financial problems. This single incident allows Andy to take advantage of his dire situation and become useful once again. Over the years, he becomes friends with fellow convict Ellis ""Red"" Redding who is adroitly played by veteran actor, Morgan Freeman. When warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) learns of Dufresnes' financial ability, he immediately takes advantage of it. This arrangement presents many financial opportunities for the brutal warden and the meticulous and patience prisoner. Both can benefit from the outcome. The warden intends to retire richer and Hope is the only benefit Andy ascribes to. Be he has he has more talent than the warden suspects. With additional characters actors like William Sadler as Heywood, Gil Bellows as Tommy, Mark Rolston as Bogs and legendary James Whitmore who lends a superior performance as Brooks Hatlen, this film is destined as a classic for the enjoyment of every audience. ****"

It was recommended by a dear friend of mine but I never took seriously until I watched the first thirty minutes of it, then I regretted that I've never attempted to watch it before that moment Hope, something good never dies, I have hope that I believe in, and I believe that someday that hope will get me through life... The Shawshank Redemption, gives hope and that's enough for a movie... I don't have that great knowledge of movie, but I do believe that this is one of the finest movies that were ever made..."
" Must See film of 90's
",,"This is the #1. Absolute must see film of the 1990s, Our Generation, anyone's lifetime and quite possibly the history of film. Hope and perseverance are front and center as themes in this blockbuster. Anyone of any age any race either sex and any religion should see this and I promise you'll wish to share it with everyone you know. Don't think ""another Prison Movie"" about-this one, it's above and beyond that cliché. Expect career performances from Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, Bob Gunton, and James Whitmore. Along side many outstanding character performances from the supporting cast. I Cannot emphasize-the importance of this film. I personally thank Everyone involved in producing such an enormous telling of Steven Kings masterpiece. It has become a source of daily inspiration for me and I continue to watch it Several times a year to this day. thank you."
" what a great movie!
",,"in my opinion ,it's better than the ordinary Monte Cristo story that we all know as the greatest escape tale , so this time the escape is greater! and the hero is an ordinary man , who is so patient and hopeful, while you watch the first few minutes of the film you may think that it's social or silly story, but minute by minute you will recognize that you were wrong, it's a Brilliant Story,a never seen before , a very powerful drama .. the best thing in that movie was the relations between characters,like hating,and true friendship like the one which was between Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman,I like this movie and i advice every one on the planet to watch it as soon as possible...."
" A beautifully crafted tale that underlines subjects that have been forgotten in modern films- friendship,hope, freedom
",,"This film is a modern classic. Why? Because it simply includes everything which builds a great story, and that is all films really are, storytelling.The concept of story telling can very easily be lost and forgotten in an industry that can sell cinema tickets by using special effects and employing world super stars like Tom Cruise. That may well be the easy option, but films that rely on pretty faces and big budgets will never be remembered. It is films like Shawshank that will lodge themselves into people hearts, and will be passed down by many generations.This is because everyone that watches this film becomes a part of it. You are there, in that prison, suffering when Andy does, smiling when Andy does. Tim Robbins plays this part so well it could be classed in one of the best lead parts in a film ever. He is simply superb. Plus, Morgan Freeman, well, would we expect anything less from a man with such talent?It is this relationship, between Andy(Robbins) and Red(Freeman) which really strikes me as a breathe of fresh air, as if i had been hit in the face by a strong wind. We are trapped in a society where relationships only seem meaningful and deep when the two people involved are having sex. Hollywood have molded this preconception that characters with a relationship must sleep together. Shawshank, for once, tells the tale of two men, who by the end of the film have a very strong relationship, but have not gone down the Brokeback mountain road of madness. Their friendship is portrayed free of sex, yet is portrayed so powerfully that you are emotionally taken back by the ending. Personally i nearly cried at a friendship so pure yet so meaningful.The plot is also perfectly timed. I am someone that is usually quite critical if the speed of a film moves too fast or if it drags on. Shawshank gives you a mixture of paces, but also keeps the story turning and turning, as if it has a heart beat, pumping more and more of the story line, unwinding the plot before your open jaw.Another subject i would like to comment on is the swearing. Again, i am normally quite critical of films that have swearing in, just to look cool, or higher the rating. Swearing in that context seems unnatural, and therefore disjointed. However the swearing in Shawshank seemed totally natural, and all part of the atmosphere of the prison.Finally, i think everyone should see this film. This is a pure, yet thrilling tale of hope, friendship and belief. The story is executed brilliantly, with intense characteriztion from both sides of the spectrum- you become Andy, and go through his struggles with him, and you hate the warden and his captain with a passion.I guarantee, by the time those credits gracefully slide up the screen, you jaw will be open, your mind will be blown, and your heart will be broken into pieces. This is a truly unforgettable masterpiece."
" Graceful, intriguing Tim Robbins triumph
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is in a league with Casablanca as a movie you can watch over and over, catching different nuances each time and bringing your own life experiences each time you watch it. Tim Robbins gives the performance of his career and this is the movie for which Morgan Freeman should have won an Oscar (a shame he had to wait for Million Dollar Baby.) There are many twists and turns and I defy anyone to watch the ending without tears running down their face. In fact, the entire last third of movie is filled with marvelous scenes. If there is any drawback to this movie, it is that it is a shade too long, meaning it's often butchered when it is shown with commercials on TV. Rent this, or better yet, buy it to get the full thrust of it. Definitely on my personal top 10."
" What else can you say?
",,"In my opinion this is the one movie that is absolutely the greatest the first time you watch it. It's probably my favorite movie. It may not have the replay value of some of my other favorites but, the first time you watch it when you don't know what is about to happen, is the probably the greatest thing you can experience in terms of movies. I only wish could I forget it so I could watch it again for the first time. As a matter of fact if I ever suffered complete amnesia there would be at least one definite benefit. I am not going to talk about the ending and for god's sake if anybody puts a spoiler warning on their comments do not read them!"
" A true tale of hope and friendship (contains spoiler)
",spoiler,"I didn't see the film in the cinema, because I was too young at 14, though when I did rent it on video, and subsequently DVD, it was and is still to this day the best movie I have ever hired out, and Now I have the DVD with all the extras it makes a truly memorable film that much complete. It's true what they say about this having an impact on people's lives as it did me. From the moment it starts and you start to hear the narration of Morgan Freeman you know there is something special to this film.The films message of hope even in the most dark situations hope can be our salvation and it is so true. The film is put together perfectly what brings the film together for me is Morgan Freemans voice it's so powerful, in his acting on screen in the film as well as his narration.There are two best scenes for me most powerful is Reds 3rd parole hearing it sums up total acceptance of what he's done and he can be open to them about how he truly feels without a care or worry in the world. The second is when Red finds the Box under the Oak Tree and the whole story seems to come together at that point. The way time progresses is an essential aspect in this film and that's another excellent example you see of Andy and the Warden almost becoming partners in crime and they develop this close bond. Prison Drama? No that description doesn't give this film justice it's a pure masterpiece and if you haven't seen it I would advise buy a copy now you won't be disappointed. Even after 50 or so viewings I still get a lump in throat."
" First 10 I have ever given out
",,"This is the best movie robbed of acclaim. I don't care what anyone says about Forest Gump. This movie is better in almost every category except music and maybe tied for movie of the year.Tim Robbins acting is as good if not better than Hanks. I always have a problem with the simpleton character getting acting nods, as with the white trash and ghetto thug characters. I think most of us can all do the Gumpy Slow Hick voice ala Cleatus the Slacked Jawed Yokel (Simpsons).I can't quite remember how many Oscars Gump stole from this GEM of a movie, but this movie blows me away on almost every level. The quite passion the Robbins portrays is surpassed by no one except maybe the Freeman sidekick character.This movie was of course a short story made into a movie (S King i think) and because of what it delivers i truly believe it to be the best movie of 1994, and probably one of the top 3 movies of all time."
" Don't Watch This Movie!! (Unless you want to Cry)
",,"I knew about this movie for a long time.Heck, prison movies, don't turn me on so I have very negative impression, hence not watching it. I watched it today (Oct 2005) as it was on TV, and I thought, it's got good rating, so I'll watch it, least this way I won't be watching it alone. Might as well get it over with.Well, any movie than can render a grown adult to tears and whirl up an emotional minefield, has to be respected. This movie has my utmost respect.This is truly a great film, even with all my negative baggage, and seeing clips, and reading people raving about it, I still avoided it.To render a grown man to cry even with all the baggage, has to be a really amazing film.This film transcends cinema, to what it's truly about - to move you. So technically, it's pointless, you can go about actors, direction, shots, music and so on, and to analyse this film purely on that level would be one very stupid mistake. A mistake many have used while writing reviews.The book or film, is simply a mechanism to get a message across, it can be flawed and still work perfectly. That's not the point.The message here is clear and works perfectly, on many unconscious levels, it really would be stupid to try an figure it out.You can't as its so simple.We all have hope dreams and desires, and want freedom and a better future. Every person does. It's actually why we exist.Not to have hope, dreams and desires and goals, is truly not to live. Not doing so, there is no meaning to life.No matter what happens, keep positive, have hopes dreams and desires, that is your purpose here on this planet this is what this film is about, everything else is just mechanics to get this across?Are you Positive?Do you have hopes?Do you have dreams?Do you have goals?Have you helped your fellow man, just for the beauty and pleasure of making someone happy, in a totally unselfish way, without any personal gain?If you haven't and don't have hopes, dreams, desires and goals, you are not alive, you have no meaning to your life.In conclusion, you can avoid this film as long as you want like I did, but when it does catch up with you... you better be ready, very ready.If you aren't or don't understand what you are watching, and what really is going on between the lines and mechanics of the imperfect mechanism of cinema you are dead, truly dead, and you might as well end it now.So my advise to you?Don't Watch this film. If you've read this far, and not got what I've been going on about you are a lost cause already, and you might as well go into your miserable life, and causing misery to yourself and others. Heck, it'll take you several lifetimes probably to get it.So, remember DON'T WATCH THIS FILM, you don't deserve it."
" Please see it and feel its magic.
",,"This is without a doubt my favorite movie. Every time I see this movie I feel touched by its magic. Most of my friends have seen it because I have recommended them to do it and they have all loved it.Robbins, Freeman and Whitmore's characters are the ones that I like the most.It is just stupid, unfair and shameful that this wonderful movie was not awarded neither at The Oscars nor The Golden Globes. The IMBD voters have it at #2. My hope is to see it in the future at #1."
" AN EXCELLENT MASTERPIECE !!
",,"Great music, superb actors. It is a pity that Forrest Gump (which I consider another masterpiece ) went out the same year and got all the publicity, as well as the Oscars. It was not fair.The only reason for which I rented this movie, two years ago, was because of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. But it was a big surprise to see one of the best films ever made. ( I have seen it 6 more times since then )It is a story of COURAGE, PERSEVERANCE, TRUE FRIENDSHIP, HOPE AND REDEMPTION.IT'S A MOVIE FOR ALL TIMES, A MEMORABLE ONE. EVERYBODY SHOULD SEE IT. YOÚ WON'T REGRET."
" Absolutely brilliant
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the few movies adapted from books that turned out to be good .. or in, this case, brilliant.Although the movie supposedly takes place somewhen in the 1950's, I can easily imagine it being transferred to today's time and standards. The thing that is most fascinating about is is that the directors [and writers, of course] didn't use extreme clichés - there's no black and white painting, just numerous shades of grey. Robbins and Freeman both are perfect for their roles, as are all of the supporting actors.Finally, I can understand why a certain movies gets a high ranking."
" A great film, but #2?
",,"A great film and one that I shall be adding to my collection at some point, but #2?One user put it very well when they said that the film's essential message of 'the human spirit conquering all' is very uplifting an' everything but sounds too much like a fortune cookie homily.There are several films that deliver the same message just as well if not better. Jim Sheridan's ""In the Name of the Father"" springs immediately to mind. That film has a similar theme to this one (wrongful imprisonment and the struggle to come to terms with it) but is a much better film IMO. What's even more heartening is that it's also true.Like I said, I'm not dissing the film. it IS great. From what I can remember all the performances are nicely judged (Freeman is excellent, but then what's new?), the direction is perfect because it's so unobtrusive to the story, and the film in general is uplifting. I just think it's nothing particularly new and it has been done better. Maybe my viewpoint is borne out by the fact that it only became a huge success on video release?I gave it an 8. To me, this fact proves that I love the film, just not as much as everybody else seems to!I think this adaptation is on a par with the short story, which was also excellent. I honestly can't agree with #2 on the top 250 list though. Is it just an American over-reaction to the movie or is every other nation as awestruck by it? Please feel free to e-mail me for discussion on this, or anything else for that matter.#2 of 250? I don't think it would make it into my top 50 films.Ah well, life's all about opinions..."
" What a beautiful movie!
",,"All is perfect : the complexity of the characters, the suspense, the principals themes like friendship, loneliness, injustice, redemption, vengeance, freedom... The most complete movie that i've ever seen. Tim Robbins is great, sensitive, brilliant: in one scene, he can feel a thousand of feelings. Freeman is very correct and seems to be really ""Red"". Gunton, Sadler and all the others seemed to have fun playing in this master of peace. Titanic is pure entertainment and received 11 oscars. This movie deserves 30 oscars because it shows what is really important in life. No action, more realistic, more useful than the other films. It was really a BIG BANG in my head the first time i saw it. When i see it again, I think and I realize the incredible power that the cinema's industry have. In a different way, only Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan and some others have the same impact."
" Wow!!!Amazing!!!Breathtaking!!!
",,The first time I saw this film I said those three words a lot to my friends and family. Shawshank Redemption is the BEST FILM I have ever seen in my lifetime. I have seen tons of films. Morgan Freeman gave a performance that will touch anyone's heart. From beginning to end this film shows how films should be made.
" Long and saccharine
",,"This bloated and soggy piece of work is so far from earning a number 2 spot on the IMDb that I have to imagine that Stephen King has bought votes for it. Trite , mawkish, shallow, unconvincing, ugly... How much more can I say about its awfulness? Morgan Freeman is tolerable, Tim Robbins is not. There is a romantic glow to the cinematography that is really inappropriate if the main characters are heterosexual. If they aren't there is an unexplored subtext poisoning the base of the movie. There is nothing else about this movie that makes a lick of sense: emotional, dramatic, logical, racial, penological. Rips off the Count of Monte Cristo and Huckleberry Finn and cheapens and flattens them. Its appeal escapes me utterly. For the love of God, sink this film!"
" Overrated sappy drama
",,"Little more than average drama for popular tastes. Predictable,  overly sentimental, and excessively long.It's a mystery to me that such a mediocre piece of cinematic art is at number 2 in the all time chart! However, predictably it's not in the top 100 more serious 'Sight and Sound'  critics and directors polls that are held every  ten years. Frank Darabont later proved to be no master with his two following films, the second rate 'The Green Mile' and the truly appalling 'The Majestic'. The fact that this pedestrian movie is, in this chart, ahead of the works of  real masters such as Kubrick, Welles, Kurosawa, Fellini and Hitchcock causes consternation."
" Overlong, Overblown and Over-rated
",,"Come on guys! According to the IMDb Top 250 THIS is the second best film EVER!! Better than Citizen Kane? Better than Godfather Part II? Better than ALMOST EVERYTHING?!?!No, it's a very, very long, very, very predictable, very, very cliched, very. very old-fashioned and sentimental film, blessed by some good performers (especially James Whitmore, who, alas, does not figure prominently enough.)It worries me that many of the comments  here seem to think the film artistically transcends the usual Hollywood fare, when in actual fact, it wallows in all the conventions of its genre.I give it 6/10, mainly because I like Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.The only people who could mistake this for a Great Film, would be those who mistake the works of Stephen King for Great Literature."
" Help me!
",,"What's going on here? At the moment I am writing these words The Shawshank Redemption is 3rd in IMDb's all-time top250. I don't think the movie is particularly bad, but to rank it even in the Top50 is a crime against a lot of brilliant film makers further down the Top250 and even more people whose works don't even appear on the list!So now I ask if anybody can please explain to me: 1) Why is this movie's average rating over 9? Does it appeal to some basic American sense of justice and love of happy endings? 2) Why did more than 65.000 people rate it? I'm pretty sure it wasn't nearly as commercially succesful as The Lord of the Rings or the Godfather with about 50000 votes. Did it do well on video in the US?And if you REALLY feel like watching movies about people behind bars why not give Cool Hand Luke or the 1974 classic(!) Caged Heat a try?I don't mean to demean The Shawshank Redemtion or anything, but I just don't get it's massive rating. Is this one of the most overrated movies of all time? Well, according to the statistics of this, the odds are that you do not think so. But would you then please be so kind as to explain it to me. Feel free to email me."
" Over rated
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is with out a doubt one of the most over rated films of the 90s.  There have been many intriguing prison movies over the years, Shawshank is not one of them. Instead it's sentimental slop served to uplift the souls of the American people.  There is never any sense in the film that Tim Robbin's character is in true danger.  If the film wanted to show the true horror of prison maybe it should of been far more darker, instead of inspiration. Morgan Freeman is wasted as usual, in the role of wisdom spouting inmate. Freeman's character is mainly there to look wise and bring inspiration to us all, but he is never treated as a typical person. Tim Robbins is good, but his character is all good, while the prison warden is sure evil. Everything is black and white.  Shawshank has potential to be great, but director Frank Darabant's obsession with being Frank Capra ruins the film at every turn."
" Mediocre people reward mediocre cinema.
",spoiler,"It bugs me that this movie is rated so high- not because it's a ""bad"" movie, but because it's a mediocre one. Apparently, mediocre people reward mediocre cinema. This movie tanked big-time when it was initially released, and with good reason. It wasn't until pseudo-intellectuals across the country started hyping it as defacto ""favorite movie"" for Lowbrows world-wide that it started dominating the IMDb ""best movie"" list. In reality, ""Shawshank"" is like a sewage pump for every idiotic Prison Movie cliché ever made. Every guard is a monster. The warden is religious, therefore Evil. Not a single prisoner is actually guilty, or if they are, they're so obviously redeemed that we're supposed to feel sorry for their unfair imprisonment. Murderers and sex offenders sit around in beatific awe as Opera plays over the loudspeakers. Right. The whole movie is so fake, so smarmy, and so condescending that it's no wonder that so many Americans, (with their odd addiction to fake, smarmy, condescending things) consider it their ""favorite movie"". I guess thinking for yourself is a burden to great for some of us to bear."
" Emotionally Fulfilling
",spoiler,"From the director of 1990's ""Buried Alive"" comes perhaps the strongest drama of 1994. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is emotionally fulfilling in every way, uplifting its audience again and again. Darabont's screenplay, adapted from (and expanded upon) Stephen King's short novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"", is at once soul stirring, heart-rending and disarmingly funny. As director, Frank Darabont brings this poignant and oft times surprising (largely unpredictable thank goodness) script to the screen with the kind of loving care that only a writer/director can, ensuring that all the right elements are brought to the surface.Startling performances from Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and the entire support cast help make this picture a powerful production. As convicted double murderer Andy Du Fresne, Robbins portrays innocence and determination superbly. He's a man who not only strongly believes he has a future, but that it's a good one. Freeman is spot on as the world weary ""Red"", the lifer who specialises in the supply of merchandise (""whatever you want"") to other inmates. He is gradually transformed, and always surprised, by Andy's optimism, geniality and brilliance. In support of these two leads are some very strong turns which provide an over all feast of superlative acting talents.The cinematography is superb, capturing some spectacular images of the foreboding Shawshank prison, while Thomas Newman's music is awe inspiring and must be duly recognised as a truly moving composition.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a long movie, though it would seem that to shorten it would mean to miss out on some powerful, if not crucial scenes. In this light, the editing team have done a marvellous job.What makes this film so effective is Darabont's brilliant script and astute direction, coupled with the strong acting and great support production. Darabont achieves all his objectives, making us laugh, cry, listen and think, he both surprises and inspires us many times. We're left in the end with an uplifting and wholly satisfying movie, which is unexpectedly memorable and magnificently rewarding. A definite triumph of the human spirit.Perhaps the conclusion could be called simplistic, but certainly not expected, and that's what makes this story so great. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" comes from nowhere to really hit you with its well written characters and even its carefully researched history. Wonderfully emotionally telling and thankfully intellectually sharp, its a pleasure that you must treat yourself to! Look for two brilliantly played characters in the form of the menacingly sinister Warden (Bob Gunton) and the despicable, ruthlessly violent Captain of the Guards (Clancy Brown).Thursday, July 27, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema""The Shawshank Redemption"" was the surprise of 1994 from director Frank Darabont. Full of emotional highs both comic and poignant, it is by far the best prison film I've ever seen. Performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are truly inspired, whilst a classy support cast lend strong backing. Cinematography is at times breathtaking and Thomas Newman's score is sweeping and melodic.For uplifting cinema that constantly comes form nowhere to move its audience you can't go past ""The Shawshank Redemption.""Tuesday, April 30, 1996 - Astor Theatre"
" One of the best films ever made.
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is an example of magical film-making at its best. When I say best, I really mean it. There are a lot of great films out there, and a lot that make me glad I saw them. But Shawshank is, above all of them, at the top of the list.I love this film. Every time any part of it appears on TNT I stay to watch until the end. I just got the DVD on New Years Eve and watched the whole thing through until 12:34 am. It was the most enjoyable thing I could have watched that night.Every part of the story is engrossing from the very first scene. The film has a way about itself that is uniquely its own. From the way it is shot to the musical score (a masterpiece by Thomas Newman).Any film enthusiast, writer, storyteller, actor, or human being must watch this film. It is masterfully executed from one scene to the next, pristinely edited, and in so many words...perfect. I myself am a filmmaker and have hard time watching even great films without judging what I consider mistakes scene-by-scene. Shawshank pulls me out of that awareness and into a wonderful story and I have watched again and again. It never stops being great. As a writer or storyteller I have the utmost respect for Mr. Daramont as well as Mr. King. The dialog throughout the film is understated and magnificent. There are more than half a dozen classic, memorable scenes that I consider iconic from this film. And to top it off, the performances from all the actors, specifically Mr. Freeman and Mr. Robbins, are timeless.If you have not seen The Shawshank Redemption please make a point to make sure you do at some point soon. It is one of the best films ever made."

",,"""The Shawshank Redemption"" should have won Best Picture for 1994. A story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) getting falsely convicted of murder and sent to the hellish Shawshank prison, the movie is beyond amazing. In prison, Andy meets Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who was imprisoned many years earlier. Red gets Andy a poster of Rita Hayworth. Over the next twenty years, Andy experiences all the horrors that one would expect in jail: beatings by the guards, rapes by other inmates, and so on. But he never gives up hope.This movie, like ""Carrie"", ""The Shining"", ""Dolores Claiborne"", ""The Green Mile"" and ""Hearts in Atlantis"", just goes to show what a great author Stephen King is. When we think of horror, we think of spooky horror, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a different kind: personal horror. Pure genius. I can only hope that in the coming years, this movie is recognized as what it is: a masterpiece. I can't believe that it won no Oscars!"
" Escape from Shawshank
",,"It is the most basic of all principles of film-making: A story of redemption. This time the story is set inside Shawshank Prison, where successful banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to during the 40s, after being falsely accused of murdering his wife and her lover. The jail veteran, Red (Morgan Freeman), sees Andy being forced through the front gates of the jail on his first day of arrival and sees him as a weakling. Red even makes a bet with the fellow inmates that he won't last. He's wrong.Andy does last, and becomes an inspiration to all of those behind bars. The warden of the jail, Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton), is intent on bringing down Andy and his defiant nature, as all villains always are.That is the prevailing message, I suppose. The redemption comes two-fold -- Andy is given time to reflect upon his life in Shawshank, and Red (who is obviously deeply moved by Andy's influence) learns a thing or two, going through a cleansing process. We see the gradual change, too -- first Red is the cynical veteran, then the curious insider, then the close friend, then the surprised object of redemption. As strange a title it may be, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a worthy one.At the end of the day, ""Shawshank"" is a good film - but far from a perfect one. I'm not interested in responding to its Top 250 placement with my review (as countless others have done), but the fact that it has been voted into the number one slot is a reflection of how universal its appeal is: it's about as likable and mass-marketed as possible. There's nothing here to really offend or provoke and the film doesn't take enough changes to potentially polarize audiences -- it plays it safe, and in my opinion, a bit too safe. The film's message of hope and redemption is way too heavy-handed, the outcome being a movie that is very simple and easy to digest -- but not really very interesting beyond its surface. It speaks volumes that so many people who have gone through depression often reference this as one of the aids they used for comfort -- it's a movie that pats people on the back and gives them hope and inspiration. That's a great message, but if you provide it without any challenge to the audience -- and instead just spoon feed it -- well, for me, anyway, it doesn't leave much of an impact. It's just a well-made but manipulative and self-important film."
" Not
",,"I've been content to lurk and learn on this web site for months, but after reading the reams of glowing critiques of this film, I felt obligated to get an IMDB account and print a contrary point of view.The Shawshank Redemption is an obvious, thinly characterized, visually uncompelling film.  Whether it's the good guy/bad guy cliche or the  white guy/black guy cliche, it's still the same old Hollywood.This is not a film which discovers life through enigmas, dilemmas, and reflections.  It is a film which wears its rather plain message on its sleeve.3 out of 10.   For prison flicks try Dancer in the Dark.  Someone else recommended alternative prison flicks Kiss of the Spider Woman and Cool Hand Luke.  I heartily agree with those choices."
" Very unoriginal
",spoiler,"I have a good friend that I can discuss movies with all day. Generally we have very similar tastes and critiques. Shawshank, is the only movie we completely disagree on. This movie insulted my intelligence from the first minute. All the prison clichés are painfully represented in this one film. The Innocent lead character, the benevolent inmate friend, the evil warden, the sadistic guard, etc.. Then of course you are mesmerized by the hackneyed subplots and obligatory scenes (i.e.) the attempted rape. About the only ingredient not thrown into this proverbial soup was a football game.This movie has some fine acting and direction, but considering its big name cast and production, the product is sophomoric at best."
" Too flawed
",,This movie is a total piece of manipulation. It does have a few redeeming features though - Morgan Freeman's narration all through is pure art!!! This guy acts with his mouth!!! As a piece of fiction it has some merit and I can see why many people would enjoy it. But to be classed as one of the best movies of all time - really? C'mon!!! Certainly the portrayal of the brutality of the guards during those times I would say is fairly realistic.The one part of the story where an old timer gets released does ring true. There are many people like that who are totally institutionalized and do not have the skill to survive on the outside without a good support network in place.This is a movie for those people who like everything laid out perfectly for them and doesn't require any thinking. Personally I like a bit more depth and reality.I don't want to put people off seeing it - it should be watched once. But for me the flaws outweigh its redeeming features.
" The best film ever made!
",,"'The Shawshank Redemption' is the best film ever made in the history of world cinema! The Best Hollywood Film Of All-Time! A Masterpiece! A cult classic! A legendary Epic! A Film that you moves you, leaves you stunned!Performances: Tim Robbins is astounding, his careers finest after Mystic River. Morgan Freeman is masterful, his careers finest after Million Dollar Baby. Others are excellent.'The Shawshank Redemption' is cinema at its very best. My salute to this flick! A true Masterpiece! I just love this film! The most powerful film of all-time."
" Very good, but probably over-praised
",,"The amazing thing about this film is how many people fail to realise that the film is about Red, not Andy. It's Reds perspective of Andy. I only mention it because many people strangely think its told from the perspective of Andy.That common misunderstanding behind, a well made film. The photography is magical, the story is strong, the performances are exceptional and the depths of despair and humanity of canvassed well without losing mainstream appeal.But that aside, there is a strong willingness to overstate this film. In the end, it is a slightly overdone and there is a bit too much 'triumph of the human spirit' dribble on the side. But I don't let that get in the way of what is otherwise a very good film with re-watch-ability.Hadley's release from prison and letter deserves a spot in cinema history. That part was absolutely exceptional."
" #2 in the TOP 250 is right!!!
",,"I saw this movie for the first time a year ago. In those days I was browsing the IMDb when I saw this movie ranked #2 in the top 250. That was very weird for me because I never heard about ""The Shawshank Redemption"" before. So I decided to go and rent it immediately. After watching the movie I was positively surprised. Definitely this is the best movie I've ever seen. The story, the direction and the cast (Specially Tim, Morgan and Gil Bellows) are perfect! The Shawshank Redemption really deserves that spot in the rankings. This movie is a ""must see""! Thanks IMDb and all IMDb users for the top 250 and the wake-up call!"
" The Shawshank BESTemption
",,"The best movie I've ever seen. I've seen her more than twenty times and it's always perfect. On the 10th year anniversary DVD edition Frank Darabont claims that the movie has helped people through divorces and losing love ones and so on, just see the movie and you'll understand why.The scene were Andy Dufresne finally gets out of Shawshank and he's standing in the rain and raising his hands is one of the better scenes in the movie history. I've got that poster up on my wall. It's amazing how you feel brightened when you see that particular scene.Try seeing the movie a couple of times, and then reading the book which is written by Steven King, and then seeing the movie again. It pushes the movie up to another level and you'll like it more thereafter."
" just great
",,"Thanx to everybody who helped to put Shawshank back to rank 2 in the top 250, in front of LotR3, where it belongs. I've seen this movie about 20 times and I never get tired of it. That's what makes a movie the best. The first 2 in the top 250 are where they belong. The 3 LotR-movies should be out of the top 10. They should create a category for special effects. Put them on top there. But for a great movie it need a lot more then effects. The story of Shawshank is absolutely great. The actors did their best. It's still a shame, that this great movie didn't got a single Oscar. It could have win the best picture in most years against all winners."
" Best Ever
",,"How many ways can I list why this is best movie of all time?1.  The most perfect ending of any movie I've ever seen. 2.  Best story - Steven King (not even a fan of his) 3.  Best acting performance: Morgan Freeman, absolutelyamazing, best ever (Tim Robbins is brilliant also) 4.  Best narration - Morgan Freeman's character 5.  Most uplifting, touching, moving story ever told. 6.  Outstanding soundtrack 7.  Beautiful cinematography. 8.  Most evil antagonist - The warden 9. Best dialogue - so many memorable phrases and quotes!I could keep going.  I've never encountered a movie that has touched so many people."
" Decent film, highly overrated
",,"I finally decided to see this film after reading good reviews and noting that this film ranks in IMDB's top ten list (currently #2). At the very least I disovered where all the noble people are: they're in prison!The film is decent, but it certainly isn't what I would call great or extraordinary. There are good performances by Robbins and Freeman, but the pace of the movie is very slow and the cinematography is unremarkable. Characters are largely stereotypes, the story is somewhat formulaic (and sometimes ludicrous), and the noble prisoners vs wicked guards dichotomy is simplistic and unrealistic. I was also particularly annoyed at the narration, which always seemed to explain more than it needed to. As for the ending, I guess I was not as suprised as others since I did read the Stephen King novella many years ago. Still, given that the story takes place in a prison, you don't need to be a genius to guess part of it.This movie reminds me of Dead Poets Society in terms of its tone and theme of uplifting the human spirit against a backdrop of despair. If that's your thing, you'll love the movie. It's not really my thing.5/10"
" Are you serious??
",,"Sorry folks, but can this film really be (one of) the greatest of all time? Entertaining? Yes. Well acted? Err...yes.  'Life affirming'? No way. Realistic? Don't make me laugh.Twenty years or so pass in this film. Does anybody get any older? Apart from the occasional pair of specs, that's it. Not an extra wrinkle to be seen. What happened to the make-up department?People get beaten to within an inch of their lives. One death and one wheelchair case, but otherwise just a couple of bruises which disappear rapidly.The 'baddies' get their just deserts and we're all supposed to shout 'serve them right' (as we say in England). The 'goodies' live happily ever after, but we knew that would happen within the first ten minutes. The people who think this is a great film probably think Stephen King is a great author. Competent and popular...yes. Great...no!! P.S. Who replaced the poster after...? Was that an oak tree? Maybe leaves are a different shape in America."
" absurd and so predictable
",,"This movie is annoying in several ways.  The criminals are all goodhearted, thoughtful, sensitive guys while the guards and warden are the REAL bad guys.  gimme a break.  What is this?  Dukes of Hazard? (which was far better than this).  Further, the plot is so, so, so predicable.  Good guy outsmarts the bad guys and real justice is served. spare me.  I know, a lot of people love this flick, but in my humble opinion it is a big waste of time."
" Saccharine
",,"Why do you like this so much? It steals directly from every other GOOD prison movie I've ever seen: The Great Escape, Escape from Alcatraz, Midnight Express, you name it. Because it allows the hero to be raped it's somehow brave or profound or heaven forbid realistic. Far from it folks. The work of hacks, only the MAIN performances are redeemable. How 'bout that warden, quite a 3 dimensional character that one. As are all the peripherals. Its bad, but in an average hollywood way. Of course it's overblown but it entertains decent enough in that much. Nothing memorable, infact I'd have forgotten it totally if it weren't for the persistant and oh so undeserved praise heaped upon it. But hey if it does it for you more power to you. Just don't talk about it's ""power"" in front of me, I may puke."
" Why? Why? Why?
",,"I just don't get it. It's not that I think this is an awful movie or anything, but no.2? Look at the rest of the movies in the top 10. Does it REALLY stand comparison with the Godfather or Seven Samurai? I think not. It's a manipulative, sentimental Sunday afternoon movie, raised above B-standard by some quality turns by talented actors. Nothing more. And who cares whether Andy could put the poster back in place or not. It's a patently ridiculous 'escape' to begin with. I understand that most of the people on this site will have a pop at me for being a snob, but the fact is I love Star Wars and Lord of the Rings and other 'blockbuster' movies. But if you're looking for a genuinely affecting drama, this doesn't cut the mustard. Sorry, guys, but you're all wrong."
" An ""O.K."" Movie, Worshiped Because of It's Accessibility.
",,"Shawshank Redemption has been elevated in popular opinion to the status of masterpiece because of one irrefutable virtue. It is accessible. Regrettably, as is true in so many cases, popular opinion is an inaccurate gauge of this picture's actual quality. The reason this film has attained its current level of acclaim is that it is impossible to misinterpret its theme or message, impossible to be offended by it, impossible to be confused by. However, as this review should show, it is entirely possible to be unimpressed by ""Shawshank.""The story of Shawshank Redemption is something I might expect if I was being pitched a script by middle schoolers. The complex coincidental frameup, the daring escape, the clear cut definitions of good and evil. the timeless friendship finally and uneventfully consummated on a beautiful shoreline. Each step more unsurprising than the last, each beat more clichéd that the last. Every time the filmmakers feel like building tension or revealing something about the characters, they take the most obvious road. This might be excusable if the road didn't also lead to the most obvious destinations.People also praise the acting in the film. While it isn't at all bad, it's hard to be impressed when the actors are playing such simplistic roles. Stereotypes when acted well are still boring.I sincerely hope that over time, when the film has settled into history and once people are more able to set this pandering film along side its heavily plundered predecessors, it will become clear that it offers nothing new, and that what it does offer it doesn't even offer all that well."
" absurdly overrated
",,"This movie is absurdly overrated by people who think soppy affirmative moviemaking accompanied by a lush score is synonymous with aesthetic brilliance.    The direction is nothing to write home about, the cinematography is, frankly, standard.  The script has Steven King written all over it - a melodramatic plot involving the woes of an educated bloke told in overwrought dialogue full of clumsy metaphors.  (A good example: the moment when the scriptwriter decided that the prisoner's interest in geology had to be spelled out for the dumber members of the audience ""It's all about TIME and PRESSURE..."" just in case anyone managed to miss the connection). Morgan Freeman is, as usual, superb but Tim Robbins is inconsistent as a man who goes from being the gaol newcomer to an old hand.  While the film's sympathetic liberal political stance can be commended, it's certainly not a great work of art."
" Worth watching, but not extraordinary
",spoiler,"Some consider it a masterpiece, some just an example of experienced film-making. I'm sticking with the second opinion. I really do like The Shawshank Redemption, mainly because of its actors, but it remains a movie which pretends to tell a shocking story while using black-and-white schemes, unlikely characters (Andy Dufresne makes some saints look like amateurs) and incomplete character backgrounds. It is utterly unauthentic wherever you bother to question its settings or characters.A better prison movie should at least give the audience an idea of what rape, the loss of freedom, the loss of contact to your family and friends, bad conditions and dullness can really do to a person.I like the movie when it manages to show me how Brooks isn't able to adapt the outside world anymore. I find it mediocre when it tries to tell me the story of true friendship, strength and hope itself lying within a prison. I do not like it when it sells me men who manage to get through such hard times without developing any kind of trauma or negative characteristics."
" Mystifyingly adored piece of melodrama
",,"That this film ranks as No2 in the 'all time' list on IMDB says a lot for how folks don't watch films from any era before the 90s anymore, for how else could it genuinely sit atop that list? I suppose in an age where everything on amazon gets at least four stars, good subjective criticism is proving harder and harder to find...but really...is this film better than Chinatown? Better than Casablanca? The Third Man? Mean Streets? Withnail and I? Better than Adam's Rib, Singin' in the Rain, Rear Window, Day for Night, Bande a Part, Taxi Driver, West Side Story, Les Quatre Cent Coups, Some Like it Hot, Seven Samurai?I've seen this film twice, once at the cinema and once on TV as I lie stuffed with Xmas dinner. The first time was mildly enjoyable, the second pretty turgid. Despite the presence of the ever excellent Robbins (though Morgan Freeman phones in the same performance he's given in every film ever since), this film never transcends the humble source of its story - a Stephen King short - and whilst it's a 'nice' tale with a reasonable twist at the end, can anyone else explain to me why such praise has been heaped on this utterly average experience?And it's not just IMDB. A recent UK Channel Four poll found Shawshank right up there. Perhaps it's the combination of pseudo-harsh prison story and a buddy tale along with the lashings of on the nose humanism that appeals across genders and other boundaries. I don't know. But believe me, if this were the 2nd best film ever made in the world ever, let's just say cinema wouldn't be the popular influence it is today.Go out there, people. Find the true 'classics', find the films this piece of sentimentalia stole its every beat, every note, every word of dialogue from. And then come back and tell me this is anything other than a hotch potch, a 50s throwback with a 90s sentiment."
" The same old story
",,"It is strange that this movie is 2nd in imdb chart, as it is the same old american story, where good people win, and bad guys died. More strange, the USA is still the place where this story must sound more false."
" Was I watching another movie?
",spoiler,"The Shawshank Redemption is one of those films that people either love or  well, hate is probably the wrong word.It's an OK film, but lacks in so many areas, most of all script and ideas. Yet again, we are subjected to an innocent man being sent to prison, governed by a sadistic guard and corrupt governor. Yet again, we see him get a glimmer of hope of release, and yet again we see hope destroyed.It's not exactly original.But, it is well filmed, and superbly acted. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman played the lead roles to perfection. The surrounding parts were played as equally well, and none let the film down. Pity about the script.Don't get me started about the poster on the wall. All the searches, and no-one took it down? Oh, come on.Watch the film  yes, even enjoy it. But please don't think it's one of the best."
" A Contrarian View
",,"Okay, let's say this from the word go...Shawshank Redmeption might as well be called Fantasy Island visits Alcatraz.  Lets just see how many shopworn prison movie cliches the picture has:1.)  A corrupt warden 2.)  Brutal guards 3.)  Homosexual gang attacks (at least not in a shower) 4.)  Innocent man sent to jail has a journey of self discovery 5.)  All illiterate convicts speak flawless english and spout witty phrases. 6.)  No racial tension, in fact no blacks with any character except Morgan Freeman doing a version of the kindly butler from a Shirley Temple picture...after all, it appears all he is there for is to be the witty sidekick and supply cigarettes and pictures of scantily clad women. 7.)  A black man runs the illegal smuggling into the prison 8.)  Nobody in jail is bad, or even seems like they could be violent, they are all a bunch of happy go lucky working class stiffs.  I guess this means we should be able to identify with rapists and murderers as they are just like us...a chilling thought. 9.)  Nobody except the hero ever attempts an escape or seems to want to escape, 10.) Over use of metaphors such as rain as a metaphor of washing himself clean of his past and putting on a new life.I am not saying that all prison films have to be a version of Scared Straight, but come on, this is clearly a fantasy prison and the very unreality of it undercuts anything the movie might be trying to say.  The Shawshank Redemption is in this reviewers eye nothing more than another holier than thou morality play packaged as ""gritty realism"" all because it is based in a prison...ho-hum."
" Three tales of hope
",,"I think that the Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies ever made. The acting is crisp and full of endless tension, sometimes forlorn and on other occasions full of fear. How Stephen King could come up with a horror story like this is beyond me. It's a real nightmare to be in a penal system with so many things going against you. Personally, I think that Forrest Gump (FG) is also a tale of Hope, but in a different sense. Firstly, FG shows the hope of waiting for the woman you love for over 20 years. Secondly, FG shows that there can be hope for mentally disabled people to continue in society and aim for goals. I think that both movies are great and should not be missed or inappropiately criticised. I also urge people to watch La Vita e bella (Life is beautiful) as it is as good as The Shawshank Redemption and has some similar points. May we all hope for more movies like these.PS Also watch It's a Wonderful Life (James Stewart) as this is about hope as well."
" One of the best prison dramas ever
",,This was a very good movie.  Robbins and Freeman are Terrific.  It was a very moving movie.  I would strongly recommend this movie.
" I thought there were supposed to be no fairytales?
",spoiler,"!!Spoilers to this movie, as well as to Sixth Sense and Citizen Kane just for spite!!Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies that oozes with ""give me an Oscar pleeeeeease"" all over it. You know the type  - like ""Dances with Wolves."" Oversentimental and overlong. It's surprising that this movie has such a high imdb ranking considering it's such a very black and white (prisoners=good, prison-keepers=evil) movie rehashing what's been hashed and hashed many times.The story concerns an apparently-wrongly-convicted banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is sentenced to life at Shawshank Prison in that creepiest of states, Maine, for murdering his wife and her lover. His main 'friend' at Shawshank is wily old-time-prisoner named Red (Morgan Freeman). Nobody can deny that Morgan Freeman is one of the greatest actors ever, and I'm not going to. Tim Robbins also gives a performance that one wouldn't guess he had in him by watching, say, ""Nothing to Lose"" (which nevertheless is a better movie). And the supporting cast is all excellent in roles that are incredibly one-dimensional. Okay, that's it for the good. Here comes the bad, and the ugly.Early on in the film, Red, who doubles as the narrator, tells us that although he'd like to tell us Andy wasn't gang-raped by some of the fellow inmates (the only bad inmates in there, by the way, and then they get sent away, so that leaves only good ones) but he can't, cause ""that'd be a fairytale.  And there are no fairytales here at Shawshank."" How wrong he is! The whole movie is a fairytale (albeit without any of the excitement and fast-pace of one).We get characters who are so completely good as to be Saints for our two main prisoners (and most of the other ones) and the Prison guards and warden who all seem to be variations on the evil stepmother from Cinderella and the evil stepmother from Snow White (heck, they're so evil, their intramural baseball team's name is the Marauders. Gee, I wonder if you people get the hidden message?).The story itself is about two-and-a-half hours of sadism (very slow-paced sadism, mind you), an hour of philosophical jabbering that, frankly, is far inferior to a philosophy class at the college if you're into that sort of thing (Hope is Good? Oh my God! What a revelation! Tell me more! Honestly, I've heard songs which have more depth than this movie!) And half an hour of the ending.It's hard to talk about the faults of the movie without giving away the ending, because, the ending itself is one of the main ones. All good movies have an ending that makes you think (or at least are somewhat open to interpretation, and/or sequels). But not this one. Although I counted at least five or six points where the movie could have ended with leaving some room for thought, it follows through to the bitter predictable end. It's as if it's saying ""you know what, you viewers are all idiots, we better not let you think about anything at all."" Even if that was true, it's quite insulting.  What's more is the ending is incredibly predictable. How could it not be, if it's told to you in the title of the movie? I mean, imagine if the Sixth Sense was called ""The Dead Psychologist"" or Citizen Kane was called ""The Sled"" (sorry, imdb censorship guys, I know this makes your job harder, but I just can't think of a way to explain it otherwise).And I haven't even mentioned the worst part. This movie is incredibly long and boring. It's not a movie that is ""slow"" or ""moves at its own pace"" - those are alright by me. No, this movie, something is always happening, but not a single thing of interest. And like that for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours. Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration. But still.Another thing is this movie's already-mentioned assumed self-importance. It's irritating at the least. It's a long, boring, unoriginal version of what Cinderella would be if somebody traded in all the women characters for swearing, rape and police brutality. I mean, frankly, Charles Perrot beat you to it by four centuries, that's close to an all time record for unoriginality!"
" unoriginal prison movie
",,"There are some things in this life we will never understand... How did the universe begin? What happens to our souls when we die? How did a movie as bland as The Shawshank Redemption become so overrated?In the case of certain other movies, I can at least understand the reasons why they're overrated. But The Shawshank Redemption is so... average. And cliché-ridden. The film's moral is basically that hope is important, and there's nothing wrong with that in itself. Heck - I have no problem with simplicity. The problem is when you move past the simple and into the land of the simplistic. The movie treats its borrowed plot parts (Count of Monte Cristo, anyone?) and banal themes as though they were freshly minted nuggets of wisdom. (I wouldn't be complaining if it didn't pretend to be anything more than a pleasant diversion.) However, it is with its very last shot that the movie reveals its true condescending colours. If it had ended moments earlier instead, with that poetic shot of the sea, I would have had some respect for it (that's where the superior original story ends). But no, the director had to spell things out for his audience. Frank Darabont knows how to tell a story. He just doesn't know how to tell one with any originality or depth.The movie is partially redeemed by three things. The majestic cinematography, the powerful score, and most of all, Morgan Freeman, one of the very best actors working today.As for my rating, yes I'm one of those jerks who gives a movie a 1 just to lower it on the top 250. I think it's outrageous how highly it's ranked here. Even the folks who made it would think it's ridiculous to consider it one of the greatest films ever made."
" Terrifyingly Overrated
",spoiler,"Shawshank is on TNT approximately five million times a year. It is the second-highest rated film on IMDb, and it was nominated for seven Oscars. It is a movie that can make grown men cry. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins deliver great performances. Thomas Newman's original score is beautiful. It's an engaging film about perseverance, friendship, will power, and hope.But then again, does it really belong in the same company as Godfather, Godfather II, Schindler's List, and other consensus top-ten films? Is it really one of the ten best films of all time? First off, the villain of the film, Warden Norton, is an incredibly cartoonish, two dimensional bad guy. He and Cal from Titanic could have a ""pure-evil-for-the-sake-of-being-pure-evil"" standoff. Aside from greed, we have no idea what made him who he was. The Warden is pure evil, and is willing to kill the prisoner who can help prove Andy's innocence in cold blood. And yet, even though Andy is the one man who could expose him and all his criminal dealings, he doesn't do the simplest thing and just kill Andy. Why not? Because Andy has to wind up hugging Red on the beach years later.Secondly, think about the scene where Andy locks himself in a room and plays classical music over the loudspeakers to the rest of the prisoners, who stop in the courtyard and stare up in awe and wonder. Are you kidding me? The scene tries to be a powerful, emotional peak in the film, but it comes off as laughably implausible, even in the 1950's.Finally, the movie makes it a little too easy on the audience by giving it all the answers. Is Andy guilty? Does he really escape? Will he and Red ever meet up again? Nothing is left for the audience to wonder about, no ambiguity — everything is spoon-fed to the audience in tasty, happy-ending bites, right up to the final ""hug on the beach"" scene. Wait this movie ends with happy people hugging on a beach? Yes it does."
" Greatest movie ever made.
",spoiler,"The Shawshank Redemption offers a life lesson; that no matter what, hope must never be lost. Hope is a good thing. In addition, it shows the true benefits of friendship, of those that care for you.Andy Dufresne was sentenced to two life sentences for the murders of his wife and the ""fella she was banging."" Inside, he meets Red. Red will learn a lesson from Andy, that hope cannot be stripped from you, no matter what is done to you, no matter what happens, no matter how we suffer, hope will always be there to comfort us. Andy's education gets him benefits with the warden, who makes him his ""financial pet"" for his money laundering activities. He does not know however, that his world is going to come crashing down on him.This movie has had a very poignant and influential impact on myself. I do not get tired of seeing it, and every time I do, I feel like nothing in this world can hurt me. Only one word comes to my mind when describing the power and beauty of this movie. Perfect.Hope will set you free."
" This movie worms its way into your soul.
",spoiler,"I have a friend who hasn't seen the Shawshank Redemption, and his comment was essentially this: ""I hate prison movies, and I hate religion movies, so I'm not gonna see a flick that has both aspects in it."" His loss. This movie, based on a Stephen King novella, is on my all-time top ten. Of course it has morals and many lessons we can learn, but bottom line, it is a great movie. Even though we know that Tim Robbins is innocent, he acknowledges his guilt on a more subtle level, his failure to be a good person. That he is in prison affords him the opportunity to become a ""good"" man for the first time in his life. He touches the soul of many inmates, in that he educates them in some of the finer things in life, namely, good music and great literature. (He corrects an inmate's pronunciation of Alexandre Dumas' last name from ""Dumbass"" to the correct ""Dumah"") The last quarter of the movie is spot-on great. We are always touched by redemption themes, just look at how popular ""Scrooge"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" have become over the years. Shawshank simply is too good to miss."
" A true story of friendship and hard times
",,"Shawshank Redemption is one of those infamous movies you never stop hearing about if you are a crazed movie fanatic. I've been through the entire top 250 list up and down and this is going back and fourth between #2 and #3 struggling with Lord of the Rings: The Retrun of the King. I had to see this movie to see what all the fuss is about.Based on Stephen King's novel, The Shawshank Redemption is a terrific adaptation of his book. The acting, I mean don't get me started. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were perfectly casted and fit so well together. What I mean in my title to my summary is, I felt that I could relate. This reminded me so much of my friendship with my best friend, because her and I are so close and would do anything for each other. Even wait until the end of time just to hang out and talk again.I felt this story also brought up major important points, what does a convict do after so many years in prison? Pretty much a good job is out of the question, same with a decent place. Your family might disown you and everything you knew was in that prison. It's sort of like being shoved from a lake to an ocean and you're drowning with no life preserver. This movie actually got me thinking about that.Also there is the final notion of the court systems, because we are also dealing with Tim Robbin's life. He keeps claiming his innocence and no one will listen to him or believe him. I felt awful for him, I know there are a lot of men and women in prison who are innocent and are paying for other people's crimes.I would highly recommend The Shawshank Redemption, I believe it's better than Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. So watch it and understand this movie, it's important. This should be watched by everyone and you get out of the movie what you bring into it.10/10"
" Nothing special
",,"This is just a typical prison yarn with some mawkish sentimenttossed in. I really don' t understand the fuss. I guess some peoplelook for grandeur and prjoect it onto middling, palatable materiallike this. That's the only explanation I've got for the unwarrantedpopularity of this flick. Production credits are fine enough, as is theacting but it certainly doesn't belong on any repsectable list ofgreatest films of all time."
" Good but not great
",,"Good acting from all concerned carries the rather simplistic and obvious storyline beyond the saccharine, but the villains are really predictable in their villany and the storyline, while initially moving and affecting, seems forced and unreal once you step back from Robbins and Freeman's performances.In other words, a high impact movie that rapidly loses credibility with considered thought after viewing. Far more worthwhile, though, than many other similarly stretched dramas and by no means a failure. But by no means in the top rank of movie making."
" Frankly, I don't get it
",,"''He that lives upon hope will die fasting.'' - Benjamin Franklin Frankly, I really don't get the praise for this film. It wouldn't even be in my Top 250. The only thing my spouse has been able to glean from researching the topic on the internet is that psychologically people seem to like the film more and more upon repeated viewings. Well, that and Morgan Freeman's calming voice. Not that challenging cinematically and a bit of a fantasy that pawns itself off as gritty realism, to be honest. Not to be an alarmist, but part of me wonders whether this film would be Exhibit A should the country ever descend into a fascist dictatorship much like ""From Caligari to Hitler"" by Siegfried Kracauer examined German film during the rise of the Nazi's after World War I. There is something going on on a group psychology level here that bears examination."
" Truly brilliant, moving and flawless.
",,"I know 'Best Movie Ever' sounds like such a cliché, a phrase used to death. Many people use it on movies which really do not deserve to be called the best movie ever. I believe that the phrase ' Best Movie Ever' should be reserved for one movie only. The Shawshank Redemption. Not so long ago on IMDb, The Shawshank Redemption was ranked 2nd. This, naturally, compelled me to buy it, and then i discovered what makes up a truly great movie.Simple plot, wonderfully acted and directed.Since watching The Shawshank Redemption, i have been preaching to all my friends to watch it. And here i must do the same. It is ranked #1 on IMDb for a reason. It is the best ever. It will move you. You will love it. If you haven't seen it, watch it.10/10"
" Why film beats books
",,"The Count of Monte Cristo isn't a very good book, and has spawned a few pretty poor films, but it's the ideas which make it an enduring story. Now whether Stephen King was consciously inspired by Dumas's (""Dumass's"") book when writing the original short story I don't know - what I do know is that Frank Darabont took a dour, typically coarsely-detailed potboiler and evolved it into something special. The big step for me, was that having taken an interesting idea and made it good, Darabont then found an ensemble cast and a cinematographer who could make it sing. I don't think there's a dull line of dialogue in the movie, and barely a camera shot either out of place or wasted. Why it is that equally talented filmmakers can spend millions and produce the kind of mindless gibberish which actually wins Oscars (like 'Braveheart' did in the year 'Shawshank Redemption' was nominated) I'll truly never fathom. Maybe there should be another way of formally recognising talent: wait ten years then take a vote - that way the mindless and the popular will have time to find their level and what's left is worth remembering."
" A prison drama starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.
",,"My favorite movie ever.  These are words that basically describe how I feel about this movie.  A prison drama does not sound like an entertaining movie, but this is very entertaining.  Tim Robbins (The Player, I.Q.) stars as Andy Dufresne a smart man convicted of killing his wife and her lover.  He arrives at Shawshank prison completely out of place, but adapts and becomes best friends with one of the prison's head convicts, wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy, Seven).  Soon the warden, played by Bob Gunton (Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Broken Arrow), enlists his help as a banker, to help with getting some extra (illegal) money and other things.  It doesn't sound like a great movie, but trust me this is the best movie I've ever seen, and everyone I know liked it.  Tim Robbins is great in the lead.  Bob Gunton is good as the twisted warden.  William Sadler (Solo, Die Hard 2) is solid as a fellow convict.  Clancy Brown (Starship Troopers, Highlander) is excellent as the sadistic head of the guards.  Finally, James Whitmore (The Relic) and Gil Bellows (Snow White: A tale of terror) give the best supporting performances as fellow convicts.  A must see."
" Not the best prison movie
",,"This movie is a mystery to me. I couldn't find anything exceptional on it. It's another HBO stuff, without any aesthetic achievement and It's absolutely conformist. But there is a fact: people love it. I want to be fair: the movie is OK, but people put it in the same place than The Godfather! Maybe I'm wrong, but it's not the best picture of all the times, not even the best prison picture of all the times. Now I'm remembering ""Cool Hand Luke"" or ""American Me"", they are stronger and wiser. But..people has the last word."
" Ho hum....
",,"I can't say much more than I was incredibly underwhelmed by this film. Perhaps it was that I had been told what a great film it was by all and sundry, but I found it utterly average.  I am afraid I just didn't get what was so fantastic about the movie.  Don't get me wrong it was an entertaining film but not the masterpiece I was lead to believe it was. Sorry."
" To predictable
",,"WEll I had high hopes for this movie.  But it fell way short.  I was hoping it would keep me guessing, but this movie was easy to predict what was going to happen.  Though I did think the acting was good by both main stars.Jason"
" Cliche
",,"This film is nothing but one cliche after another. Having seen many of the 100's of prison films made from the early 30's to the 50's, I was able to pull almost every minute of Shawcrap from one of those films.While it is visually well made and acted, the story has every plot point of the ""standard"" prison film. They have the evil warden, innocent main character, friendly guilty guy, thugs and one good old prisoner. Don't waste your time on this one. Rent or buy some of the classic's of the prison genre."
" my backlash vote
",,"Saying this is the #2 movie of all-time is like saying McDonald's makes the best hamburgers. They're both palatable, predictable, inoffensive products that are easy to digest. Both have happy endings-- that is, if you find the stunning speed with which a McDonald's hamburger flushes out your digestive tract to be a ""happy"" occasion.All you need to know is that Shawshank has the exact same ending as ""Trading Places."" So why not make ""Trading Places"" the greatest comedy of all-time?? What the hell, why not make it #3 on IMDb? It too is competent and utterly middle-of-the road in terms of quality and originality within its genre.Instead of Dan Ackroyd and Eddie Murphy laughing it up on a Caribbean beach after besting the forces of evil, we get Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. It's the exact same ending! Shawshank was OK when I saw it when it came out. But count me among the backlash group that would rather see it with the 6-7 rating that it deserves. Thusly, I hereby cast my symbolic 1-star vote."
" A cute and sentimental prison drama?
",,"Quite frankly, this is a movie of clichés. You want examples, I got examples! ""Some birds are not meant to be caged, their feathers are too bright"" or ""Get busy living, or get busy dying"" or ""Terrible thing, to live in fear"" or ""It was like some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made those walls dissolve away"" or ""need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone"" or ""Hope is a good thing, and good things can never die"" - if you say so, sensei!Problem is Stephen King never leaves anything to the imagination. He tells us everything - if Tim Robbins organises some special event for the inmates, like playing music over the loudspeaker, Morgan Freeman's voice will come right out and suggest a few reasons why this episode is so wonderful/significant, the nature of which are very similar through each episode of the movie. And Darabont obviously likes the idea of assuming the audience are very thick, and will not see or experience anything unless you dictate to them what to experience, and has made his movie by it.Also, i'm starting to be wary of Thomas Newman as a composer doing exactly what Darabont has done as a director: employ a formula that has worked in the past. His score for Shawshank is calculated on the same formula of highs, lows, and general atmosphere as in his score for Road to Perdition, American Beauty, Meet Joe Black, Horse Whisperer, Scent of a Woman, and The Green Mile, not surprisingly. If you think about all these movies, they all have a similar feel, they all go for a similar nostalgia, haunting sadness - which admittedly i find very appealing, but i'm starting to worry at how similar they all are.I think encouraging this movie too much is like rewarding someone for employing a formula very successfully - instead of taking risks and doing something edgy that still turns out to be enjoyable and brilliant. Most people do not evaluate movies based on their IMDb ranking, but i certainly would be surprised if any major lists ranked this in their top ten.That said, this is still a good movie, with good performances, a good unity, despite its necessarily episodic nature, and it looks great. Its only for movies people insist on putting on best-ever lists that i require a certain originality, the feeling that what this movie gives you you could not get anywhere else (I believe this is why movies like Citizen Kane, Vertigo, 2001, Raging Bull, Third Man, Grand Illusion, Persona and, for me, Exterminating Angel, are constantly mentioned on such lists, and deservedly). What this movie gave me, I could get from reading any other Stephen King story, or seeing any other movie adaptation of a King story."
" Crap
",,"I'm not going to tip toe around it, this film is crap. Its completely unoriginal, its not artistic, its not demanding (except for being boring). You will not learn anything about the world through this film.This film is not a part cinematic history, unlike nearly all other films in the top 250. It is predictable and emotional crap.But even if your not into cinema, and you just like popcorn entertainment there are far better movies out there...basically any on the video shelf."
" Most Overrated Film of All Time
",,"Sorry folks but this movie is a C movie and not an A. I can't believe that people like this movie so much. Yes I am biased, I really don't like Tim Robbins but he has made a decent movie or two but this ain't one of them. This is your basic prison movie. What can I say- it has the host of usual characters.  The storyline is basic, the outcome I won't say but it is just stupid to say that this is a great movie. I didn't think it was realistic at all and anybody who falls for this crap is either delusional or needs some brains to differentiate between an Edsel and a Lamborghini. I wouldn't watch this movie again unless I was paid to do so. One viewing is enough for this predictable laugher."
" On the world's finest films

Unfortunately, the guidelines of this site preclude me,oh gentle reader, from giving you the URL.

" Am i missing something??
",spoiler,"The basic story for this dreadful movie is Andy Dufresne is a young and successful banker whose life changes drastically when he is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. Set in the 1940's, the film shows how Andy, with the help of his friend Red, the prison entrepreneur, turns out to be a most unconventional prisoner i think am missing something with this movie, having now seen it twice. Its 1 of the most predictable boring movies i have ever seen. The bit were all the prisoners stop and listen to the opera music is just laughable. This just would not happen with hardened prisoners. This is also one of the poorest performances i have seen from Morgan freeman, why he took this role on i will never know. Go watch the Green Mile, its much finer work from the duo of Stephen King and Frank Darabont"
" Didactic and overlong
",,"Another one of those overlong morally right-on movies that never rises above average - saved only by the acting.Its bleeding-heart politics 'dignity of individual maintained in adverse conditions' is played-out well enough but actually lacks any real dramatic tension.Dufrane is a two-dimensional character who seems to go through the drama by numbers - there's never any doubt that he will triumph in the end, it's only a matter of how.Tim Robbins has done many more interesting films than this one - try The Player or Bob Roberts if you're looking for drama/moral ambivalence and how they interact.Basically, there are a lot better prison films than this one - Jailhouse Rock for starters.Like most Stephen King stories - quite prosaic. There was a story in here somewhere but it got over-inflated and somewhat lost along the way.
One to watch on a rainy day when there's nothing better to do."
" What's all the fuss?
",spoiler,"(slight spoilers, nothing crucial) This is a competent movie, but its presence in the rankings completely baffles me -- it might as well be 'The Pelican Brief'. Its scenes are schematics into which emotion might be put (for example, the schematic of the despairing ex-prisoner Red), but they lack the ragged richness of real feeling.  Where 'Kiss of the Spider Woman' overwhelms us, this shows us a series of events."
" It is ordinary movie only..
",,"I don´t like movies about ""way of life"" or about a hope. In this movie is handled a problem with ""normal life"" or with resolution to take a life to ""own hands"". A topic of this film is such like Papillon. This is not an authentic subject, this is not an authentic movie...."
" A heroic fable, but nothing more.
",,"I found this movie to be rather trivial and predictable.  It was, in many ways, a Forrest Gump version of a prison movie.  It had a manipulative and superficial plotline, and the leading character was too good to be true. It never dealt deeply with any issue at all.  Basically, you liked the leading character because he was perfect, and cheered him on and hoped for his success, just like Forrest Gump.  However, unlike Forrest Gump, I could never see the true emotion of the Tim Robbins character.  He didn't like being sexually assaulted, but we never saw how that affected him; he didn't drink but got beers for his friends.  He finds pleasure out of the simple things and doesn't like unpleasurable things.  He turned out to be a perfect character with no negative qualities at all.  Maybe he's this way for a reason; people can relate to him because they like to think of themselves being completely perfect and think they would make every right decision if they were in a situation like this.In many senses, this was just a morality play, with Andy Dufresne being entirely good and all the prison officials being completely bad.  I think the only reason why people enjoy this movie so much is that it has the message ""Good things come to those that try and do good with their lives."" However, I didn't think the movie had enough substance to offer any deeper meaning or insight.  The best thing about this movie was it made me realize how great of a movie Forrest Gump is and how great of an actor Tom Hanks is. He made the Forrest Gump character seem to have a fully round personality and allowed us to understand who he was.  He seemed possible.  Andy seems unlikely and not relatable because we never see any reasoning behind his personality.This movie moves people because it is a heroic fable.  It's not a worthless movie experience, but it should have done more with what it already had. To the people that think this is the greatest movie ever made...spare me. My rating 4/10."
" What's all the fuss about?
",,"Obviously I missed the point of this movie.  After years of people telling me how fantastic it was and noting how high it regularly comes in opinion polls, I finally watched it recently.Somehow I seem to have come to completely the opposite conclusion to almost everyone else.  Maybe my expectations were too high but I was very, very disappointed.  The plot was predictable and dull, the directing pretty droll.  Not much else I can say about it, other than to ask people if I have missed something key that would alter my perception of this film?Who am I to go against the vast popularity of this picture?  I must be the exception that proves the rule. This (apparently) is a ""must see"" movie."
" Overrated
",,"I cannot possibly realize why this movie is rated in top movies. There is nothing new in this film and there isn't anything in it that makes it special. Wake up people! Quote Bill Hicks ""Piece of Sh*t"".OK I'll give it that there isn't anything to complain about the acting or directing, etc. But this entire movie seems to be a compromise. I also think that the success of this film is based on the ""least worst principle"" and that makes it bad.I'm also fed up with the narrator and all the dramatic film music. All this seems like fishing Oscar nominations. Am I really the only one who can see how transparent this is? I doubt it so please vote movies that really will make difference."
" #1 on IMDB's top 250, one of the best movies of all time and more than 6200 reviews... what's more to say about this movie?
",,"As I said in the summary, there are too many reviews for this movie and it's among the best movies of all time. So, why I wanted to review it? Because this movie touched me so deeply and I found it so great and powerful that I have to say my opinion at all costs. This is out of my system, now I can go to the review.THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a masterpiece and only a idiot wouldn't watch it (or hate it). Everything in this movie is perfect: the dialogue is clever and well written, with many great lines (included also in the narration by Morgan Freeman), the cinematography is great, the soundtrack is among the best that were ever heard in 1990s movies, and the performances are very strong and heartfelt. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give their best performances in their careers. Robbins is hard to empathize with at the beginning, but more the movie goes on more you come to like him. Freeman also narrates the movie, and here is suave, easy to empathize with and likeable (as in all his other movies). And also the supporting players in the movie are good, including James Whitmore in one of his final roles as Brooks Hatlen.My favourite scene apart the tear-jerking ending? The scene of the inmates listening to the Mozart aria through the speakers. So, you don't have to like prison dramas for liking this movie. Yes it's depressing and sad in points - but is also perfectly and cleverly written and acted, and deserves all the praises that received. A movie that has to be seen at least once, and if you don't love it I suggest you to go to a psychiatrist!"

" Simply Amazing

It's the perfect movie, it's like God decided to allow the creators, writers, and actors to blend perfectly together - with the end result being the greatest movie ever written. The first time I saw it, I thoroughly enjoyed it but didn't allow for the intake of dramatic genius to fully set in. I have seen it over 100 times since I first 'experienced' it, and now it is impossible for me to watch any scene without getting chills down my spine. Frank Darabont should have a day made in his name for his adaptation of Stephen King's compelling and brilliant story. No one could have surmised that allowing for one of the more likable inmates to be killed would make the movie even MORE powerful...but he did. One last thing...I just wanted to thank God for allowing them to change the ending to that of a diminishing Robbins and Freeman at the end, no words needed."
" Simply AMAZING!

'The Shawshank Redemption' is one of the few movies I've seen, where emotion and story are perfectly blended into one absolutely AMAZING story! You can feel the terror from Andy's trial, you can feel the happiness from the beer on the roof scene,the anger from scenes involving The Sisters, the shock when he learns that Tommy was killed, and the hope, joy and happiness gathered together when Andy escapes.The acting was amazing, the adaptations from the book were spot-on, this is the greatest adaptation I have ever seen. Of all the people in the world, I have never met one person who didn't enjoy it.If you haven't seen it; why are you sitting there? Go out and rent it and see for yourself, how amazing this film is!"
" It is a good film and i like it
",,"When i first watched it i like it at once,it is really a good film.i can learn a lot of things from it.¡°The Shawshank Redemption"", which is a movie about time, patience and loyalty - not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods. But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society - who is strong, who is not - and the measured passage of time. Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized - that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside. Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system. There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison - and us, too - is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine. The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own. Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.All in all, I think it is a very good film and worthy for everybody to watch, the most important sentences ¡°Hope is a good thing , maybe the best of things, No good thing ever dies.¡± It is really make us thinking deeply, and another one which was said by Red, he said that there has one kind of birds that you could never keep him in the cage, because every feather of his body was covered by the brilliance of freedom. I think everyone should remember this , everyone of us are covered by some brilliance of our own, we should never give up no matter how difficult it is! And we should remember that ¡°hope is a good thing¡± ,we should have hopes for all our lives!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
" Number two? Fine by me **** (out of ****)
",,"I have long viewed the Shawshank Redemption as the most underrated film of all time.  That isn't to say that it wasn't universally acknowledged by the movie-going public as a great movie, but in terms of awards, critical acclaim, and best ever lists, this has somehow kept on losing out.  Now that I see it has the number two position, as voted by the movie-going public, on probably the most accurate best ever list in the world (AFI be damned), I am eminently pleased.  There is no way Forrest Gump should have won best picture over Shawshank.  Certainly, Forrest Gump is a charming, well-acted film, but it is nothing compared to this.  Morgan Freeman excels, and Tim Robbins turns in his best performance.  If you haven't seen this masterpiece, get up and rent it immediately."
" One of the best movies of all time
",,When I first saw this film I wasn't that Mesmorised but as I thought about it I began to notice it's Symbolism. The more I thought about it the more I liked it and now it is my second favorite movie. Morgan Freeman is one of the best actors of are generation and the thing I love most about him is his voice. Tim Robbins is perfect as a quit sincere Andy Dufranse.This is one of the best movies ever made and deserves more publicity from critics.
" One of the best flicks of the decade.

Compared to so many recent movies that are eye-candy, this film delivers the true meaning of friendship and focuses on this aspect instead of flasy cars, lasers, dumb plots and high paid actors bloated with self confidence.Another movie along the same line is ""Spitfire Grill"". Rent it and you will probably enjoy it as much."
" one of the best

There are so many good things about it that it is hard to even come close to mentioning all of them, so I'll only mention the one thing I liked the most.  I liked the fact that the movie could have ended a couple different times, and it still would have been one of the best, but for Shawshank that just wasn't good enough. It kept going until you felt the ending was so perfect, that you truly had to sit back breathless.  I love this movie and it will always be one of the best as far as I am concerned.  A true classic!"

This is one of his finest, a difficult and complex portrayal of a veteran convict, who is so long a part of the numbing prison culture that we're somewhat surprised by his sympathetic understanding of the unfortunate Andy DuFresne, movingly interpreted by Tim Robbins. People are in prison, for the most part, because they belong there. Prisoners don't normally exude compassion for their fellow unfortunates, but Freeman's ""Red"" noticed right away that DuFresne was of different stuff. Their friendship cut across both racial and social lines, and that it was forged in the furnace of a prison conducted by so corrupt a warden as Norton, was a magnificent testimony to their bond. Clancy Brown as the warden's personal storm trooper could have been reduced to caricature, but he turned this difficult role into a memorable portrayal of mindless violence. The great revelation in this film was Bob Gunton as the warden. There has rarely been, if ever in film, a keener reading of a character given the charge of men who've been reviled by society, and thus forgotten and who are totally dependent upon his good will for their very survival. Norton was the essential bureaucrat who, given sufficient backing from an indifferent public, can build from the foundations up, a system which brutalizes and murders men, and which exploits the last vestiges of their self-respect for his personal ends. The narration by Freeman in his great baritone lent an authentic base line for the kaleidoscopic unfolding of the film. James Whitmore's poignant turn as a man doomed to death outside of prison is proof of what lengthy incarceration to do to a man, turning him into a slave who is addicted to the very structure which denies his humanity. That both DuFrense and ""Red"" each managed to leap over the abysses which yawned before them, was the great cathartic experience of the film."
" My personal favorite
",,"It was a great and a pleasant surprise to see that the movie that I chose almost five years ago as my favorite movie of all time is the number one on the list. Although it's my favorite, my choice was based mostly on my personal reaction toward this movie and I did not expect that there are so many people that feel the same way I do about it. I love every single thing about this movie, every single shot. And believe me I know what I'm talking about because it's the only movie that I've seen so many times and it never failed to amaze me.A great story based on Steven King's novella, great direction by Frank Darabont, and great acting by Tim Robbin and Morgan Freeman. Not to mention music, and the truly original and always inventive dialogue. Every body who commented here on this movie probably mentioned all the obvious great things about it. I would like to add one thing that made this movie even more spectacular to me. The movie contains scenes that present a complete idea that stand and work on its own. Like the scene when Andy plays Mozart or the scene on the roof. Critics might choose others, but there's no other movie touched my soul like this one, and I've seen thousands of them. Remember ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies""."
" Few shows offer What the Shawshank Redemption does
",,"In the first thirty minutes of watching this show on a slow Saturday afternoon I knew it was my favorite.  I was captured instantly by how the story unfolded.  You can't help but deeply respect Andy Dufrain (I don't know if thats spelled correctly).  The way he speaks with thought and hope, the way he walks about the jail collecting rocks.  Seemingly oblivious to the fact that he is imprisoned in a jail.  They couldn't have found a person that suited the roll of Red better than Morgan Freeman.  His voice is perfect for the narration of the film.  Every card played by this movie was an ace.  From the way they filmed the tall, barren walls of the prison to the brilliant story( thanks to Stephen King for that), and let's not forget the music.  I am pleased to see that it's in the top spot of this site, I think it deserves it."
" The best, pure and simple.
",,"In this era of television, and cable television, and satellite television, we are bombarded with movies, old movies, new movies, PPV movies, made for TV movies. There are so many outlets these days, that its unlikely that you'll watch any movie on TV today, and not have another opportunity to watch the same film, in its entirety within a week.Amidst this morass of celluloid, and electronic representations thereof, there are films, which never leave you. You may be absentmindedly changing the channel on a Saturday afternoon, or late on a Friday night when you come across one, a scene, any scene, will play. Whether it be from the beginning, middle, or end, it hardly matters-- it is immediately recognizable to you. Your mouth will begin to make the words the actors are to say, unconsciously. A smile may come to your face as does a friendly, warm feeling inside, you may feel a tear, or fear the tear to come.You will move aside the bedclothes you were changing in order to find a spot to sit on the end of the bed, you will adjust the volume to your taste. You will not go for a drink, or a snack, but remain, transfixed.Such is the magic of movies, and there are many movies for many people, but 'The Shawshank Redemption' is one for us all. It is the sweetest music, and our conductor, Frank Darabont is indeed a maestro.The wonderful story behind the making of the film starts with  the generosity of  Stephen King. King of course gets a premium price any time one of his novels is adapted. He has chosen to give young, unproven filmmakers an opportunity to adapt any of his short stories (as opposed to the novels) for the bargain basement price of $1. There is only one caveat, that they send him a video tape of their finished film. This opportunity, Frank Darabont took to advantage and made a short film, based on a King story, ""TheWoman in the Room"".  And King was impressed. When years later Frank Darabont came back to King hoping to adapt something called  'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption', King was only too happy to accede.What came from Mr. Darabont is true cinematic history. Thank you sir, thank you both."
" 9 on a scale of 10
",,"Ok, as I give this movie a 9, it is going to be hard to be critical, but I feel as though that is the responsibility of anyone who doesn't rate a movie a 10.First of all, the acting was sensational - as good as I have seen in a long time. The direction was great and the script was great. And, it turned into (unexpectedly) a true buddy story.I could only criticize a couple things - one of which was NOT the length - 2:20. I found it a little troubling that most of the criminals were extremely nice guys - except for the obligatory bad guys in the shower. I also have to confess a real distaste for the homosexual overtones - especially early on. But, then what prison movie attempting to depict real life could leave that out???Also, prison movies in the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's are not my favorite genre, however one of the advantages of prison movies are that you really don't care very much what period it takes place in. Anyway, that is just personal preference.All in all, it deserves the praise it gets. I'm very glad I finally took the time to watch it."
" One of the best
",,I really like this movie.  It was very well done and the screen play was great.  Totally awesome plot and the best acting I have ever saw.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.  It was a movie to die for.  You could tell that they put time and efffort into making this masterpiece.
" Faithful Story Telling
",,"Stephen King was surely pleased to see one of his works faithfully represented on-screen. The director does an excellent job of showing the bleakness of prison life, the frustration of a life gone awry, and the misery of losing all one holds dear in life, while somehow preserving the hope of better things to come. Every actor was perfectly cast and the story-line draws to a perfect and satisfying close. If you enjoyed the film, you'll love the book from whence it came; ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption""."
" The plain & simple truth. It doesn't deserve to be at #2.
",,"just read the title. Tough I think it's a pretty decent movie (but not as good as the Stephen King's novel) i just can't understand why it should deserve to be ahead of everyone else in the top 250 (with the exception of the godfather). To be honest i don't even really think it should be in the top 250. Yeah, I know you Americans love the happy-ending Vaseline-flavored subtly homosexual jail movies, but all this hype it's too much anyway. Come on, this can't be better than Welles, Kubrick, Kurosawa or Scorsese (or not even Carpenter and Fulci in my humble opinion) So I give it a 1/10. This is not a critical valuation of the movie. This is a political statement."
" Proof That The Internet Can Be Misleading
",,"The notion that this movie belongs in the top 100 of anybody's list is simply retarded.  This B-movie with an A-movie list is standard, run of the mill, TV-movie-of-the-week fare.  How did it get this high?  What's wrong with the vast number of IMDB users that they would vote so highly in favor of such a piece of trite?  My theory: Tim Robbins is sending each of you a check.  That's the only explanation.  This movie offers nothing special: nothing different, nothing unique.  No great performances (a phoned-in Morgan Freeman performance akin to his ""Deep Impact"" presidential performance), no graphic portrayals or stark realism of life behind bars--nothing. This movie achieves what few in history have done: it both sucks AND blows."
" A good movie but definitely not #2 of all time
",,"This is certainly a good movie, with universal themes of freedom and adversity etc etc, but... I've seen plenty of movies which were more artfully made than this one. There is nothing revolutionary in the directing. The novella by Stephen King is practically tailor-made for a movie adaption, and it seems any capable director could have made a good movie from it. I think the only reason this movie is #2 on this list is the sheer amount of people who have seen it and voted. The other truly great movies near the top of the list don't pack the same mass audience appeal that Shawshank Redemption does, nor are they shown on TNT 6-10 times a year. Movies like 2001, The Seven Samurai, or Lawrence of Arabia, for example, would bore many of the people who love Shawshank Redemption, and I personally consider those three I named and many others to be far better creations than the Shawshank Redemption. Perhaps we should take a poll of TNT viewers on the best movie of all time - I'd bet Shawshank Redemption would place first, with The Blues Brothers coming in a close second."
" After a big buildup, a real disappointment
",,"After reading all the rave reviews for this movie, it turned out to be a real disappointment.  Can anyone really believe that the prisoners are honourable men while the guards and warden are all ""crooks""??  Haven't we overdone the hypocritical ""Bible thumper""?? -- let's find a more enlightened characterization.  James Bond, himself, could not have followed the main character's escape plan.  The ending soliloquy and denouement were inferior plagiarisms from ""Cool Hand Luke"".  Enough!!!  Unfortunately, fine performances by both Robbins and Freeman were wasted in this ""fantasy"" story."
" emotional strangulation
",,"It's an ""emotional manipulation for dummies"" type of film, with boring direction and cardboard characters. Nice performances by the actors though, some great moments, but nothing outside the ""Hallmark meets Stephen King meets Prison"" feel of the entire movie.I saw it one and a half times, and would see it again only if I got paid for the trouble.Similarly, I hated 'The Green Mile"", only later did I find out it's the work of Darabont.My recommendation: Skip this, and go see OZ again."
" Not the greatest movie of all time
",,"Shawshank is nothing more than a fairy tale.  It tells us as much about what prison is really like as Pretty Woman tells us about what prostitution is really like.  People like fairy tales, so both these movies were very popular."
" Over rated
",,"The acting is adequate, the story is adequate, but why all the fuss?It sometimes baffles me why some movies get such high ratings when they are really only run of the mill.This is not that bad a film, just seen it all before."
" A sociopath prison warden, sadistic guard as well as cuddly and misunderstood inmates.
",,"Shawshank Redemption is overrated. It's a decent, above average film, but by no means a great film.The inmates are pretty much likeable, while the warden and his pet guard are monsters. Also as Freeman's character says: ""You know that everybody in here's innocent?"" As the story develops you feel like he is right, the only criminals are the ones guarding the prisoners.This is a sentimental piece made to stir the emotions, but not to stir them too much. Just enough to make the viewer feel there is injustice in the world but that in the end everything ends well and justice surely comes to he who waits 20 years or so for it.The Shawshank Redemption is, as I said, a decent film, possibly among the top five films of 1994. IMO the best films of 1994 are Pulp Fiction and Léon."
" good one but not the ""second best of all time""...
",,"I cant understand why this movie got such a high rating. its a good movie but there are lots of others that deserve to be number 2 in the ""best of all time list"" (american beauty, pulp fiction, Chaplin's, Buñuel's or Kubrick's movies, just to name a few). Well..I'm an old Stephen King fan and the story of ""Redemtion"" is good and thrilling and the acting and photography is good as well but its nothing that has'nt been made before. don't get me wrong i liked it but i think its just a well made entertaining picture and nothing more.So watch it and have a good time but don't expect an artistically great work or something all too original."
" Deserving of its praise
",spoiler,"Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and is sent to Shawshank prison: For Life. Andy is a very intelligent man, a hot shot banker when he was free, and now he's just a number, at the mercy of Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) and his head guard, Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown).Andy is a quiet man, but manages to attract the attention of the sisters (Barely Human Homosexual rapists) led by Bogs (Mark Rolston) and he begins his prison life, desperately fighting his admirers, sometimes he'd win, sometimes he'd lose, but he always stayed quiet.Red (Morgan Freeman) is the man who can get things, and he is Andy's first friend on the inside. We witness Andy's relationships with Red, the Guards, the Warden, the sisters and the rest of the inmates, develop through Morgan Freeman's perspective, but always revolving around Andy. In his time there he successfully wins personal battles, gains favour with the guards and inmates alike, and restructures the rehabilitation of so many with his unwavering persistence and drive.All the members of the cast are more than adequate, but i have to single out Freeman and Robbins. Freeman guides the viewing audience in an informative and subtle manner, and Robbins, in his finest performance ever, gives us hope and wisdom, as he manipulates the powers around him so cleverly, to make life as easy as he can for all his fellow inmates.The Movie is very powerful and moving throughout, and it doesn't shy away from the darker aspects of prison life. And at the end when the climax falls into place, you will be left completely satisfied by its unquestionable brilliance.For those who have not seen this movie, all i can say is watch it.10/10"
" Good acting, average story
",spoiler,"** Some spoilers about the general storyline **I had some expectations regarding this movie, because of the excellent rating it got here. To start with the positive: the acting (especially by the two protagonists) is indeed of the highest level, and some scenes really grip you. The camera-work is also excellent (beautiful prison-building!)The story of this movie is a 13-in-a-dozen story about someone who (of course) is wrongly sentenced to a long story; who meets his new friend (mostly an elderly person), who makes enemies and defeats them, who turns his long-stay into something good, then is betrayed by his corrupt warden, etc. etc. Sometimes it even got a bit cheesy, the way in which all the prison cliché's were displayed.I could recommend this movie to you, if you are looking for a nice drama with good acting and good camera. Don't expect an Oscar-worthy movie, though."
" A fantasy indeed.
",,"The popularity of this film seems to stem with the current emotional appeals and issues of today, just as Citizen Kane seemed to do when it was revived. What makes Citizen Kane more appealing to me though is the abundance of creativity in telling the story.If you want a highly emotional experience, I would watch this movie. Since I am for more intelligent and unpredictable type films, I am not one for movies like this.And if I would explain the movie in one sentence, I would say it is a classic cinema soap opera, perfectly crafted to emotionally stimulate movie viewers, in order for them to hold certain perspectives on societal issues."
" Listen up!
",,"I don't want to offend anyone, some of you actually seem quite intelligent, but listen up: If a movie is on the on top 250 list, in this case second from top, it simply states that this film is the second best liked film in the ""IMDB"" world. You can't argue that it don't deserve it just because it aren't as creative, innovative, artistic or influential as many other films are. ""THE SECOND BEST LIKED""! It's a fact. Swallow the truth.Movie lovers, as opposed to the general movie enjoyer, have, like most disciples of art a much more developed, or trained mind when it comes down to their field of obsession and will choose accordingly. (You can't expect your classmates to love jazz, prog rock and classical music, just because you do.) Shawshank Redemtion is, obviously, generaly an enormously likeable movie and even some of the most artsy people people I know accept it as valid and enjoyable entertainment. In my book it rates a solid 9/10. It's indeed, along with Back to the future (that ranks high much because it hit me so hard in my early youth.), my favourite mainstream movie of all time!FJL from Norway"
" ""There's something inside they can't touch.""
",,"Let me review this film on two aspects: it's merit and it's high placement.
First of all, ask yourself this question: Is a film great simply because it achieves? I hope many think this is not the case. Shawshank has a slow and methodical pace. Along with good performances around the board. The simple staging and lighting of the film is over-done in it's simplicity and I personally see no art in it at all. But, I'm not saying it's a bad film. It's not, and it's far from it. But to be ranked over vastly more intelligent efforts is a sad reflection on our society.
The writing is top-notch. The best thing about the film is the flow of the story, and I could have simply read a book. I am no huge fan of visual effects or quick paced story-telling ... but I am a fan of art. Reading a book would be as enthralling as watching this film. Seeing the acting is like watching lines being delivered, but being delivered well.As for it's rating on the site ... the film pushes no boundaries in which film often offends people to the point of disliking it. It has a nice uplifting story at the end and presses a lot of hot buttons. Including murder, infidelity, and scandal. Searching for the soundtrack for this film is what brought me to IMDb for the first time, actually. So I dare not say this is a bad film; I only say it's ranked higher than vastly superior films.Rating: C+"
" The Most Over-rated Film Ever Along With American Beauty
",,"O.K. you've seen the summary and you're screaming ""What kind of sour limey b@!*&%$£ says that about one of the greatest films ever made?"" Well I've got news for you, look again. The Shawshank Redemption is a very good movie, i agree but is it all it's cracked up to be? - no. At first you think ""I feel great - what a feel-good movie!"" One can't help wondering that this film, on closer inspection, is actually unbelievably cheesy. Every other second i was hearing violins about how this poor guy got landed in jail for a murder he didn't commit. It's stereotypical - and you guys who voted 10 bought it hook, line and sinker. ""But what about the great twist?"" O.k., the twist was good but come on...like i said before was it THAT great? Ask yourselves honestly, was that better than The Sixth Sense's or The Usual Suspects? Also, how come foreign films which are far superior to this get no credit? Watch Le Samurai, or La Haine or Todo Sobre Mi Madre. Far more superior."
" very average
",,"The only thing that amazes me about this movie is that it is not only within 500 top movies in IMDB but actually #2 and soon perhaps #1...I only saw Shawshank Redemption once, and have not been able to force myself to watch it in full length ever since. It was ok to see it once even though I was almost bored then, but not quite. I found it very average in every respect, and quite predictable. I guess that this is one of those movies that is so average that it does not bother anybody by invoking powerful emotions, thoughts or memories, and does not have any obviously bad technical quality. Just sooo average. Hence the high score?"
" Sugary sentimental and unsatisfying
",,"This drama has been widely vaunted as one of the best films ever made- personally I just can't see the appeal. Sure it contains very good performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman- but there have been other, much better screen performances by other actors. There is very little suspense or originality about the plot and nothing that hasn't been seen or done on screen a hundred times before. So why the popularity? It's a formulaic feel-good movie who's happy ending is never in doubt. Knowing that Stephen King wrote the novel on which the film was based would probably give that away anyway. As with any adaptation from book to film there are several differences between the two, though the film does, on this occasion, improve on the book.There have been better adaptations of King novels (The Shining) and better performances by better actors, yet for some reason this film continues to be rated as better than it actually is."
" More like The SHAM-shank Redemption - SPOILER
",spoiler,"Over-long, boring, tedious, over-acted and very very very very very OVER-RATED. Hell knows what goes through the minds of people to vote this the 2nd best film EVER!! I first saw the cut down version lasting 1 hour 25 minutes, and it was still too long.I wouldn't mind but it's so drawn-out, fanciful and pathetic. The things that happen in that prison would never happen, just because some nerdy bank manager has ""hope..."" Give me a break! Which soap opera did that sad line come from! No wonder it was initially ignored, and it should be continued to be ignored. Robbins, who is accused and wrongly convicted for the murders of his wife and her lover, never ages. At one point he HAS TO ""remind"" us he's been in jail for 12 years, because it only looks like a week.Yet did you see the way he really changed in 12 years from 1994 to 2006. He looks a much older man. And of course he does, he's 12 years older!! In the Shamshank Dedeption he never aged one day in 12 years, and his hair is even cut the same style.Even when we then go forward something like 20 years, he still looks the same, never aged at all, apart from a few bluey grey hairs at the sides. And after he escapes (after 20 years of tunnelling through thick concrete with a a small screwdriver), he meets up with his old buddy Freeman, who got out of jail legally. And get this, BOTH look younger than when they first went in.By my reckoning Tim Robbins should now be about 70, and Morgan Freeman in his early 80s, yet both after serving their time still look barely 40.And what a load of talkative rubbish. The most boring over-hyped-up film in history. Complete twaddle. God knows how on earth I watched all of it, but I did if for a bet, 'cause I cannot stand it. Wasn't worth a UK tenner anyway!! My vote, 2 out of 10 for a mediocre drama.Get a life, if this is the ""best"" film you've even seen. Better still, get a cinema ticket!!!! Or rent a DVD. And more than one!!"
" Pale imitation of better films
",,"Three words: ""Cool Hand Luke.""  Same film, done better, done earlier.  For that matter, is this film any better than other Steven King ""novelettes"" such as ""Stand By Me""? All in all, it probably ranks a 6 or a 7, but since people on this site have lost their minds as regards this film, I give it a 1 in one man's attempt at sanity."
" No Redemption from Shawshank
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is reasonably well written, directed, acted, and filmed. Yet in my judgment it is a below-average movie. It lacks a real plot, and, while the title promises redemption, nobody and nothing is redeemed. The characters lack depth, and many events are implausible.No doubt, wardens and prison guards can be wicked people. But those portrayed in this film are so completely perverse that they become uninteresting. Their function is to represent ""the establishment"" and ""authority."" The audience is meant to identify with Andy Dufresne, the main character. While innocent of the murders of which he is convicted, he's hardly an admirable character, and he becomes worse during his imprisonment. He's a clever manipulator who eagerly cooperates in the warden's criminal activities in the hope of profiting from doing so--which he eventually does. The prison also has has a contingent of homosexual rapists, who are called ""not human"" so as to avoid admitting that their behavior is all too human, and very much in need of redemption.Thus, the film's popularity: it appeals to our tendency to rationalize our own wickedness by comparing ourselves with moral monsters. Unfortunately, serving that function does not make a mediocre film great any more than serving sound moralism does."
" Excellent Stephen King adaptation; flawless Robbins & Freeman
",,"THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (1994) **** Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton,Clancy Brown, William Sadler, James Whitmore, Gil Bellows. Excellent adaptation of Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption"" with falsely accused of murdering his wife Robbins facing hard time in a corrupt prison and a solid friend (Freeman in an unforgettable Oscar-nominated performance of stoicism). Great acting and above the preconceived ""prison film"" genre that also breaks away from the cliché of the human spirit yet enables its elements. Nominated for several Oscars including Best Picture, Screenplay Adaptation and Director."
" The Shawshank Whimpering
",,"Have watched the thing twice and frankly I still don't have a clue what the fuss is all about. There's hardly anything special about the movie, let alone breathtaking, intriguing or groundbreaking. The beginning is somewhat promising, but pretty soon it all gets painfully predictable right down to the moment the credits start rolling. The narrative is way too often overdrawn and phoney, the music - heavily pretentious and irritating. The performances are not bad, but let's face it - the script is far from demanding. The storytelling is overwhelmingly fairytale-ish and even the drastic bits seem oddly out of the place, as if thrown in to make the thing feel more dramatic. Words keep flowing in abundance, soothingly creating the impression of a nap story told by a lit fireplace. Having recently watched the ingenious ""The Straight Story"" I was astonished to see how much damage may be done to a picture by putting in too much talk.All that is not to say the movie is appaling. However, an inch above average is as good as it gets. Both ""Midnight Express"" and ""Escape From Alcatraz"" beat the weepy Shawshank experience hands down. 6/10."
" I'll compare it to a poem
",,"Originally, I wrote a very long review of Shawshank Redemption, but i've decided not to post it.  Instead i'd just like to say that i would compare the movie to a poem that i wrote in 5th grade.  i'm not going to write the poem out because i don't have it with me right now, but it had to do with rainbows and waterfalls and following your dreams. In other words, it was complete b.s. I just wrote what i thought were some typical poetic themes and threw them together, hoping people would like it.  My plan succeeded, the teacher thought it was the best in the class, and it got published in the school newspaper. Seems like the director of The Shawshank Redemption, Frank Darabont, and the writer of the book, Stephen King, did the same thing.  The movie is technically well made and does succeed at telling the story.  I admit that I got caught up in the ending.  But no matter how much you try to defend it, it's still pure Hollywood.  Cliche here and there.  I recognize this for what it is:  a director's attempt to manipulate people's emotions, which, due to a large amount of naivite in the world, succeeds.  He did the same thing with The Green Mile with more success.  Now, with The Majestic, I am glad to see that it seems that most reviewers and many moviegoers have recognized this, and given it generally lower reviews than his first two films.  Finally!  Now I only hope people will start to give Shawshank lower ratings and get it down from the heights of the top 250 list."
" Overrated, absolutely not a classic.
",,"After seeing this movie I could not notice to be misled by the IMDB rating. The movie is nice, even good, but no way it should receive a 9.0.The movie could easily have been produced by Disney: strong moral & a happy ending. Sure, there are strong points. The scene of the old man who have been imprisoned for almost his whole life is very well placed and Tim Robbins' performance is good but the story itself does not leave anything behind. 3 out of 5. That's all there is to it."
" Best film ever?!
",,"I too was dazzled by this movie when I first saw it; Robbins and Freeman were both fabulous and the story was an intensely happy marriage of the nostalgic and edifying to the tense and disturbing. The theme of success against the odds is rarely so emotive, and the desperate hope and yearning are truly palpable.But it's simply NOT the best film of all time! Parts of it are cliched, most of it is downright implausible. The symbolism is trite and way too in-your-face, particularly with Freeman explicitly spelling out (albeit touchingly) what should have been the movie's duty to portray.The ending was a shameless exercise in trying to make the world feel better than it's ever felt before. Films have every right to be manipulative, but when it's this blatant the magic collapses. Or did for me anyway.Mind you, still a smashing flick. I'm only nit-picking because everybody else seems to be in such a weird frenzy of Shawshank worship."
" Good but ludicrously overrated
",,"I quite like this film but it wouldn't make my top 100. The idea it's the greatest film in history is laughable.Of course the acting's terrific. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are solid as ever, even if Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown (the Baddies) chew the scenery. And that's the problem - everything is so terribly black and white, with every character springing straight out of a three word summary. Our hero is Good But Flawed, Red is Good And Noble, the Warden is Just Plain Bad and his henchman is Reminiscent Of Another Film (okay, four words).I've never been inside a prison, but I can't believe all the prisoners would be so damn nice. There's the ""sisters"" - a bunch of horrid rapists, of course, but they're nothing a small plot contrivance can't eliminate. The ""sisters"" aside, there's nary a cross word from a prisoner in the whole film.Racism is also curiously absent. American prisons today are notorious hot-beds of racism. Martin Luther King's dream is bizarrely alive and well in Shawshank, where colour doesn't get a mention in twenty years of ""history"".This total lack of realism means it's not really a film about prison at all. And what kind of ""character"" film can be centred around someone who seems entirely flawless (other than perhaps in his choice of attorney).I can whinge about the mechanics of the film as well. Voiceover narration is irritating enough - but Red narrating events at which he was not present? Pur-lease. And that final scene - talk about a director who didn't know when to shout ""cut"". It didn't need much self control to stop at the point Red heads towards Mexico - films for grown-ups shouldn't need endings that resolve any uncertainty.Speaking of the director, isn't it odd how the maker of the ""Greatest film in the world ever"" is also credited for The Fan, Eraser, The Blob and The Fly II? It's as if Orson Welles directed ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", or Francis Ford Copolla helmed ""Megaforce"".I don't mean to make this out to be a bad film - it's far from that.

" An Incredibly Overated Film
",spoiler,"This is why I have a problem with IMDB. They rated this film as the #1film of all time. Are you kidding me? It wouldn't make it into my top 50. Why? Because they are like the ""Peoples Choice Awards"". How about ""Citizen Kane"", ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or any film Stanley Kubrick made. They blow this out of the water. Yes, it is entertaining and good, but I cant stand a monologue that is simply repeating what has already been shown on the screen. It is idiotic to do that. Why? Because Morgan Freeman is simply telling you what you are watching on the screen as if he is a football play by play announcer. Woefully overrated. I gave it an 8 when it really deserved a 7 at best. These people at IMDB think a comic book film id great. What are they; pre-teens?Get over yourself."

" A must have!
",,"One of the greatest movies of all time. The movie encapsulates all the values that give hope, patience and motivates us all to never give up. The characters, their performances is so unique. The musical score is by one of my all time favourite composer Thomas Newman. Timeless Masterpiece! Must have... Must Watch. . Must Share!"
" Excellent movie that i would recommend to every movie lover out there
",,"This movie is pure excellency.I love every aspect of it.It's one of those movies that you can watch many times without getting bored.The story is about Andy, played by Tim Robbins, who has just been found guilty and sent to prison to serve a life sentence,where he meets Red,played by Morgan Freeman, and with time they form a bond.Shawshank Redemption has it all,and during the movie you can feel a big spectrum of emotions,from feeling happy for the characters,angry at them,fearing for their well being,and being really sad for them.This movie takes you on a roller coaster ride through all of those.The acting is top notch and the actors performance is so good that you can see the personality of each character and start bonding with them.One of my favourite things about this movie is the Morgan Freeman's narrating skill,you can easily see the movie through his eyes due to his convincing acting.It also shows how people, when they get locked up for a long amount of time,start to adapt that kind of life,the prison becomes their world and in time ,that's all they know.Their life used to be bigger,but now it got scaled down to simple pleasures.For an example, when the guards but the prisoners a few beers,they get really happy,they feel free once again,well at least for a couple of minutes.I would recommend it to everyone 10/10"

" Get Busy Livin' or Get Busy Trying to Analyze This Film
",,"Before you write this review off, please know that rating it a 4 does not mean I hate this film.My rating system may be a bit different than others. If a movie exists, I want to immediately give it a 5. A 5 seems very middle-of-the-road for me, and I want to give each film the benefit of the doubt. So, I automatically go into a film thinking it's a 5, and if it goes well or gets better as I watch it, that rating goes up. The rating goes down if I see more negative than positive aspects about the film.I explain my rating process to ensure to others that I do NOT hate this film. I thought it was okay - nothing special - but far from a disaster, and yet, further from a masterpiece.As this review is intended to be more advice for first-time viewers, let me get right to the crux of my view on the film: The Shawshank Redemption gets a lot of hype. It has been the pinnacle of many Top 10 lists since its release, and even IMDb here has it at the top of its Top 250. So, unless you have lived most of your life under a rock, you are fully aware of the attention and praise this film has gathered since 1994. Do not - I repeat, do NOT - go into the film expecting great things. If you can watch the movie without any preconceived opinions, that would be the best. You might thoroughly enjoy Shawshank. Going down the checklist, the movie has just about everything you need for a great film: Theme: It's got ""redemption"" in the title, everyone. I think you can figure it out, but the film also touches on forgiveness, endurance, and friendship - all good themes to explore in film Acting: Morgan Freeman is amazing, as always. Tim Robbins is loved by critics (I've never particularly cared for him), and does a decent job of conveying a full spectrum of emotions Source Material: It's based on a Stephen King short story. Stephen King has been cinema gold, as far as I can tell. The Shining, Stand By Me, and The Green Mile have all been successful It all sounds so good, right? Well, I would definitely tell you to watch this film, as I think most films should be given a chance, especially modern classics such as this one. However, I would not believe all the hype.For me, it was an average film with major expectations, and ultimately, I was let down. I can't say that watching this movie was anything like being in prison, but I could actually connect emotionally with Andy by the end of the film."
" What is all the fuss about?
",spoiler,"SR is a good film. In my view it is not a great film! Firstly - it is lazy film-making to have a character (Red, in this case, played by Morgan Freeman) as a narrator to tell us what is happening. The film itself should convey the narrative. If someone has to read the narrative I might as well just buy the book!Secondly - the story is simply not believable! I can't believe that a prisoner gets to do all the tax returns for the guards and governor. I can't believe that a prisoner entering the prison just happens to have a heard another prisoner in another prison boast about committing the murder for which our hero is serving time. Thirdly - the story all ends up 'happy ever after' which is seldom the case but which, I suppose, satisfies those of a simplistic/idealistic nature. I prefer more grit and realism.Fourthly - the 'goodies' (Dufresne, Red, Brooks) and the 'baddies' (Bogs, Hadley, Norton) are drawn so simplistically they might as well have been wearing white and black hats! There is no depth of character here.Fifthly - and most damning - this film made me feel very little! I didn't really care about the characters (except - maybe - Red). The plot with Dufresne taking on his alter-ego on escape was clever and the suicide of Brooks was a bit moving but this was not enough for me. I go to the cinema to be moved by the plot or the characters; to be made to think; or simply to laugh! This was not a laughing film but neither did it reach me on any other level.It was also too long!"

" an alright movie to watch
",,"It is not uncommon to hire people to write reviews on social networks that should appear to be by independent contributors. That's why i had to laugh when i saw The Shawshank Redemption being the best rated movie on IMDb. But since there would be little sense in making such an effort to generate more than a million votes and almost three thousand reviews for a movie made in 1994 i assume this is genuine.In any case, based on Stephen King's novella, The Shawshank Redemption was an alright prison movie to watch. However, it displays what i see as typical for King's work. When he's writing science fiction, fantasy or horror it all sits well. But when he writes anything that should mirror reality it simply feels fake in the same way as wearing a cotton shirt and the one made of synthetics feels different. The events might have been based on actual events, but i haven't been convinced.Obviously when you make any kind of list, there will always be a first place. On IMDb it is currently being taken by The Shawshank Redemption."
" Best film ever made...
",,"Watching this movie was a pleasure, the acting was outrageously good. A film without special effects and action every 5 minutes, just men in prison. All I can say is I would have loved this film to have been longer.The acting from Morgan Freeman is second to none, he proves in this film why he is regarded as one of the greatest actors to grace our screens. Anyone who hasn't seen this film needs too watch it straight after reading this review as it will change your opinion on a lot of other films."
" Great films come only once in a blue moon

" Yes...
",spoiler,"In 1947, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth, followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. Andy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the ""bull queer"" gang ""the Sisters"" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston). In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a pretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice and expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from nearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decrepit library. In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his receiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that he holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him, but Red dismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias ""Randall Stephens"". In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for burglary. He joins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In 1966, after hearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy reveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and preferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary confinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being unrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a specific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package. The next day at roll call, upon finding Andy's cell empty, an irate Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. The rock tears through the poster, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and the prison's sewage pipe with Norton's ledger, containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him the following morning, Andy, posing as Randall Stephens, visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money. Finally, he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest. After serving 40 years, Red receives parole. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo, he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited."
" Great film
",,"one of the films that you must watch in lifetime. A film about long-term imprisonment that takes its time to convey what the slow crawl of a lifer's existence might feel like. Thoroughly gripping, and pretty refreshing. Ten years ago The Shawshank Redemption was a low-key prison film that didn't recoup its costs. Slowly it has become one of the most popular movies of all time - and, for some, it has even been life- changing. It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope."
" The Best Movie Ever Made
",spoiler,"Where do I start? When I first heard of The Shawshank Redemption I immediately wanted to watch it, mostly of its title, so as I always do I looked it up on IMDb and looked at the rating. It was the highest ranked movie on IMDb, and of course I would give it a go. The beginning was very interesting, with Andy being convicted of double homicide and seeing the lean-back of what happened. Him being found guilty, serving two life sentences in the toughest prison in America, Shawshank. I thought it would be another overrated boring movie like The Godfather, but no, it caught my attention from the start and never lost it either. The dramatic scenes, it gives you a glance of how it is in prison, the emotional scenes. It is all a masterpiece, there is a reason to why it is the best movie I have ever watched and probably will ever watch. The amazing acting, plot and moderate length. The last scene, with ""Red"" walking up the beach towards Andy and the credits slowly rolling in, it makes you beg for it to never end. When it comes to movies I can sometimes get a little emotional if its a good movie, which Shawshank is. It definitely deserves the spot as #1, I cannot understand how it didn't win an Oscar.I really recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good weekend, but get a load of potato chips and soda, since you will finish it all up very fast."
" Can't find a better movie
",,"you can't get more, from a motion picture Morgan Freeman undoubtedly is a great actor and finding him as supporting actor in movies has been a culture in the modern cinema.The movie have a great plot the director did a great job, concentration on the story have a solid field and the scope to keep you sticking to your chair the movie have such a dialogue delivery that you have to pause if you even blink your eye.Shawshank Redemption as the title is tempting so is the movie the star cast is great the performance can't get better, and criticizing the all the rules and regulations of the society challenging the so many other other things the movie becomes a legend to the todays actors enough war movies enough jail breaks you have seen in movies but it's all inspiring all contributing to the society and the diamond to the industry and the milestone for the coming actors is this. Tim Robbins performance is great as he lived the role and the eye stretcher movie shawshank redemption."
" The unbelievable creativity of a human mind..
",,"I cant believe that something so simply good exists. This is by far the best thing i have ever watched on my TV. I loved every piece of it and i'm gonna watch it once a year till my time on this world is over. I can't describe the feeling and joy you will have after watching it, because i can't find the right words to describe it. Watch it and you will see what i mean. The first time is always the best. It's the time when it will leave you speechless for a couple of seconds. And after those seconds you will begin to understand that you just watched a masterpiece. What i liked the most is the big time span in which the movie plays. All those years in one place and the dependence for some people after you leave it."
" My review about Shawshank Redemption
",,"When I watched Shawshank Redemption at first,I had been in the high school and this film left a good impression with me, I say that I learned how to follow your passions and hopes, how to struggle to be free. And "" don't never forget,hope is good something and good somethings never die "" this sentence which passes in the film, I always believe it every part of mine. Because A person lives with his or her hopes and passions so, If it is seized from people,that people lose their aims in the life. And what the best properties of this film, It shows that hopes and passions are indispensable for people...In addition to my review about Shawshank Redemption, Whenever I watch this film, I learn that it puts in new things my life. It is so important for every watcher, Shawshank Redemption should be watched and I advise it to you :)"
" have patience for the first half n hour
",,"First of all you need to be prepared for this 3 hour long movie(though the movie worths it).Morgan freeman's background voice will keep you with the story.Dialogues were well executed.The strongest part was it's narration which makes it the best.I wouldn't have watched this if it wasn't on the top of IMDb list.At some point of time i felt the movie is just dragging on the story.Still at the end you won't mind it. The movie also carries the message of friendship,hope,will and brilliance of our protagonist.Sometimes i felt pity on him and sometimes i couldn't stop myself praising his brilliance.I think this movie will keep impressing generations ahead,no matter how much advance human becomes."
" Absolutely phenomenal, a true master class. This movie manages to show viewers how the difference between good and evil is about perception
",spoiler,"I had heard a lot about this movie being a 'classic' and a 'must-see' and normally that negatively impacts my view of a movie because unrealistic expectation often ruins the true quality of a movie. This movie, however, managed to surpass all my expectations.I didn't know much concerning the story, except that it was a movie set in a prison but it's so much more than that. The major theme that became apparent to me throughout this movie was how we regard as good and evil is largely dependent on the storyteller and how he chooses to paint the heroes/villains. Convicted felons are not usually considered 'heroes' or people that you root for and want to succeed but the story is about so much more than that. The Shawshank Redemption is about hope and more importantly the struggle to maintain it, when the world is doing its best to crush it.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's on-screen chemistry is amazing. There are no weak scenes, no wasted dialogue. They are the best things about the movie, they make you believe, they make you hope."
" If you aren't a fan of Stephen King, Frank Darabont, or anyone else involved in this movie, you will be!
",,"Yes, Stephen King writes drama. He also wrote Stand By Me, The Green Mile, and Dolores Claiborne. He has definitely been typed as a horror writer, when he is an amazing tearjerker. This film is amazing. Words cannot describe just how amazing this film truly is. I thought that I would not like this film, as it looked like ""a bad sports movie"". But, when my science teacher told me I should see it, ""because it's a movie where you just go, 'wow'"". I did and I was literally in tears by the end. Not in tears of sadness, but tears of joy. Because the film was simply so beautiful. Not very many films have made me cry. Of course, I cried at the endings of Marley and Me, and Toy Story 3. But there are only 3 films I've ever cried at. Some people say Citizen Kane or The Godfather are the best movies ever. FALSE. They are overrated. This film is a diamond in the rough. Most people are stubborn and won't even take this gem into consideration. It truly is the best movie ever. The music, the direction, the cast. I won't give anything away, you need to see the film to appreciate its true beauty, but I will say that the music in this film puts John Williams to shame, and the movie reminds us that even in the most bleak of situations, life can still be great. It is a great movie because it reminds us that hope is something that nothing can quench."
" About as perfect as a movie can be
",,"I do not even feel as though I need to go into a great amount of detail to explain just how amazing this film is.You've probably seen the movie sitting on the top spot of 'IMDB's top 250', or maybe you've heard a friend babble on about how great the movie is and know it must be half-decent. I can assure you this will live up to your expectations. The acting, the plot, the setting, the cast, the directing, the messages and symbols, the acting again (deserves another mention) is just about as perfect as a movie can be in this setting. Please don't waste your time pondering over whether or not to see this movie or whether or not you should believe the hype because, I can assure you, you can. Go buy this from your local movie store or buy it online - I really don't care - just make sure you watch this film before anything else. As an 18-year-old guy, I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see. Go watch it! Now!"
" Phenomenal
",spoiler,"Personally I was, and I am ashamed to say this, quite late to join the huge number of film fans that would hold The Shawshank Redemption within their Top 5 films of all time - if not number 1. If you're wondering mine is ""The Princess Bride"", childhood favourite but that's beside the point.I think the first time I watched it was in 2006 and I instantly fell in love with it. I now watch the film at least 5/6 times a year without fail and I am hardly ever far from tears of joy by the end.If you use the old analogy of ""If an alien came to earth show them how..."" to make a film, you would show them this as the blueprint.Just brilliant."
" Just Exceptional!
",spoiler,"I'd heard about this film a few years ago and I'd heard it was good. I was lied to. This film wasn't good, It was outstanding! I can't believe I never watched this sooner! From the opening scenes where the mysterious Andy Dufresne is being dragged into hell to the credits as Red runs across the beach to him, this film was, in a word, Perfect! No holes to spot, almost everything was completely accurate, Probably some of the best script I've ever heard and a brilliant story. Normally, If a film goes over two hours, I start to get a little bored and I end up wanting the film to end but this was completely the opposite! I never wanted this to end and the hefty 140 minutes get you wanting more and the story drew me in so much, I felt as if I was there. Normally with films adapted from Stephen King books, they don't do so well on the big screen but this has proved that wrong! Overall, I like this film because it's realistic, it goes into great depth and the story is so gripping, you can't take your eyes off the screen and this film will always be there at the top as one of my favourite films ever!"
" Review - The Shawshank Redemption
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is currently number one on the IMDb Top 250 list. I don't particularly agree with that, but it is a truly great movie nonetheless. It is moving and compelling, and it touches the heart and soul.The story is set in the 1940s, and it involves Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins), a young man who is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to life in the Shawshank Prison. As one would expect, he is very unhappy at first, but then he leans that there's something deeper that nobody can take away from you: hope. As the story unfolds, over the years, Andy eventually becomes very influential within the prison and gains the respect of other inmates, especially ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), with whom he develops a special friendship.The story isn't original or creative, and it's relatively simple, and a bit predictable, but it's compelling, moving, and memorable, and there's a bit more to it which I won't go into. The movie puts the viewer right into the footsteps, experiences, and emotions of the characters. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman put on great performances. They really bring out their characters and offer true depth and emotion. One of the major moral messages of the movie is that a person may be imprisoned, even for life, but the spirit can never truly be imprisoned. The movie conveys this moral message very strongly, and it truly touches the heart and soul.I am very glad I watched this movie. It is a truly emotional experience."
" The greatest movie of all time
",,"The best movie ever made, period. I won't go on a very long and detailed review on the story(which is magnificent and perfect)I just want to say that this movie is a pure piece of art. The acting was perfect! I'm really disappointed that the actors didn't have enough recognition for their performances! Actually, the overall movie was underestimate, by the Oscars especially.This movie shows why cinema is an art, powerful and heart full art. See this movie, you'll now what I'm talking about. I really tried to notice some gripes or problems but, I can't. This movie is touching, sad, beautiful, powerful and perfect. By the way, f**k the Academy Awards for dumping this movie and do for Forrest Gump for the trophies,but it's just trophies... Still a shame that they decided that.11 out of ten, totally deserves it."
" My all time favorite film
",spoiler,"This film is about hope, friendship and redemption. It has solid performances from Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton (the warden). Freeman masterfully narrates and he is the life blood of this film. You experience everything through him; friendship, despair, hope, redemption and happiness. The musical score is nothing short of fantastic and really elevates some of the more moving scenes in the film.Firstly, this film is about hope. Andy is wrongly accused of murder and is sent to Shawshank prison. He has no friends and is quickly picked on at arrival because of his quiet, unassuming nature. But as time passes, the other inmates begin to respect Andy because he doesn't allow prison to break him. Andy perseverance is so strong that it begins to rub off on the others. I think to really get this film, you need to step away from the context of it just being a prison movie. You could say the prison is life. The warden and the guards are problems, trials and troubles in life that can test and possible break you.No matter how bad things yet, no matter what brutal things you have to endure, you've gotta hold out hope, you gotta hang on, you have to believe you're gonna get through it. This is about the very nature of the human spirit, told in a very simple, straight forward way.This film is also about the power of friendship. I think Hollywood seems to have a hard time portraying a meaningful, male friendship and just resorts to endless buddy and stoner movies. Shawshank does a great job of this. I felt this aspect of the film was told in 2 parallel stories. The first was the old librarian, Brooks. When he was released, he struggled to adapt to the new world. As Red says, he had become institutionalized so much so that without Shawshank he felt alone, afraid and had no purpose. In the end, it was just too much for him to bear. Easily one of the more heartbreaking scenes in the film, gets me every time. When Red is released, he faces the exact same challenges that Brooks did. And he too struggled and almost lost hope. The only thing that kept him him going, was his friendship with Andy. As Freeman narrates:""There's a harsh truth to face. No way I'm gonna make it on the outside. All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole, so maybe they'd send me back. Terrible thing, to live in fear. Brooks Hatlen knew it. Knew it all too well. All I want is to be back where things make sense. Where I won't have to be afraid all the time. Only one thing stops me. A promise I made to Andy.""It was literally the only thing he felt worth living for and a key part of the film I think people forget. And before Andy left prison, you could see how it deeply affected Red. He had lost his friend and the heartbreak of it was written all over Freeman's face, fantastic acting if you ask me; it was subtle, quiet suffering.And finally the film is about Redemption. Some people feel the redemption is Andy's. But I believe that Andy was just the agent of Red's redemption. At the start of the film Red was pretty much redesigned to life in prison. He had accepted that these were just the cards he was dealt and there was no real reason to feel otherwise; he had given up hope. The first few times he went for his parole hearing, Red was just going through the motions, he was just saying what he thought he had to get to be let out. It was completely insincere.You can see an the film progresses Andy changing Red. There's a great scene where Red mentions that he used to play the harmonica. Andy gets him one as a present and later, in a small but important scene, Red picks up the Harmonica and he quietly plays a note. For me this is where Red begins to believe again. But the key scene for me is the last parole hearing. Red has been so affected by Andy, that for the first time he has a genuine moment of repentance, where he honestly admits to his crime:""There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret. Not because I'm in here, or because you think I should. I look back on the way I was then: a young, stupid kid who committed that terrible crime. I want to talk to him. I want to try and talk some sense to him, tell him the way things are. But I can't. That kid's long gone and this old man is all that's left. I got to live with that. Rehabilitated? It's just a bullshit word. So you go on and stamp your form, sonny, and stop wasting my time. Because to tell you the truth, I don't give a bleep.""It really is just an incredible, moving scene, one of my all time favorites. Red is completely broken and regretful, it's nothing short of movie magic. And the ending? Well, let's just say it leaves me with a smile on my face. In my opinion this is the greatest film ever made. An incredibly powerful, uplifting story. If you haven't seen this, you need to.http://andretms.blogspot.ca/"
" The Most Magnificent Movie Ever
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly the best best movie ever. The Oscar's biggest mistake was giving Forrest Gump the awards that Shawshank deserved. Not to take credit from Forrest Gump which is also an amazing movie, but it just can't compare to Shawshank. Morgan Freeman arguably delivers his best performance and Tim Robbins gives a performance that I feel is greatly underrated, and also deserved an Oscar nomination. The films art direction adds to the story's beauty, and gives off a feeling that fills you with hope. I remember seeing The Shawshank Redemption on sale for $5 at Wal-Mart and thinking ""I heard this is good"" so I bought it. Little did I know the film was worth more than gold. I bought the film and put off watching it for a couple weeks, not overly anticipating watching it, but finally decided to watch it when I was bored. I am a gigantic movie buff, and have so many movies it's almost pathetic, but The Shawshank Redemption changed my entire view of film. Now, every time I watch a movie I can't help but think ""It can't beat Shawshank."" Some people say that this movie is overrated, but that's wrong. Shawshank is an actual work of art, to be compared with works of DaVinci and Picasso. When people say this movie makes them cry, they don't mean to say it's so sad, but that they didn't know that something of such beauty could be conveyed on screen. I believe that if everybody see's only one movie during their life, it should be this one. See it now. After that, IMDb will seem like a whole new website because every film will seem like a different movie. It is, by the very definition of the word magnificent."
" Best Movie Of The Era
",,"To be brief, as a man who has watched thousands of movies in my life, Shawshank redemption is the best movie I have ever seen. The plot, the way it develops, the acting, the portrayal of every human emotion, and the ending makes 99% of movies seem like just a waste of time. I didn't see it until a few years after it came out. My sister said it was a great movie. It was on HBO, so I watched it. I was speechless. I have always found it strange that it was from a Steven King novel. I've read a few (not that one) and what comes through in the movie doesn't seem like anything that would be in a Steven King novel. A better movie may come along but it may be a while."
" The best film I have ever seen
",spoiler,"This review contains spoilers so better see the film and then read my review.Sometimes it makes me wonder why this film didn't go well in the box office. Shawshank redemption is not just about a story where a man escapes from a jail. It captures the life of people who spend their life in jail. I believe that jail life and free life are almost similar. Sometimes we enjoy and sometimes we feel sad whether you live in jail or not. Sometimes life doesn't make any sense at all. Some people succeed in their lives with ease and some people faces a great deal of hardship and still won't succeed in their life. These people are forced to the point of desperation. What they should know is that all of us have a destiny to reach and the main thing which matters the most is ""hope"" which you should need until the moment you die. If you believe in yourself and have hope then one day you will reach your destiny in this life or in your after life.This film has really changed my way of looking the life."
" Simply the best film ever made.
",,"Well as the other more than 2000 review say it, in my opinion this is the best movie created so far. It basically just how life is: you get punched in a face time to time, but you have to stand up, keep your hope and give value to your fellows, because in return life takes care about your reward. Oh yes, and if you face any evil that you can stop, do it. This is the message of the film, if we follow it, life may be as rewarding ultimately for us as for the hero. Other films that moved me like this: Forrest Gump, The curious case of Benjamin Button. IMDb says I have to write another line in order for them to post my review so here it is xD"
" Best film ever
",,"If you have not seen this film yet, you are really missing something in your life. It is almost like never tasting Coca Cola.This film is that good. The great Morgan Freeman not only puts in the greatest acting performance of his life, but quite possibly the greatest performance of all time.The script is so excellent that every word spoken sticks in your mind and later on in the movie you remember every word before it is recollected.This film makes you angry, upset, romantic, sick and elated. It touches all of the senses and you cannot take your eyes off the screen for one minute.The cinematography is excellent and so is the research and hard work that has gone into ensuring that all of the costumes and props are of the era."
" I just love this movie
",,"The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable. http://howtogetridofacnequick.org"
" Best movie ever
",,"One of the best movies that i have ever seen.It truly transcends time and is an epic in all proportions.People just don't make movies like this anymore and this is one of my favorite movies of all time. The movie is About Andy Dufrane,a banker who has been wrongfully acquitted of killing his wife in cold blood and send to shaw shank prison.the movie shows the various hardships faced by Andy and how he does not give up hope and carries on with patience and finally becomes free. the climax is absolutely spellbinding and will leave you aghast.it is a truly great movie and i was aghast at finding out that this movie was a failure in the box office.BUT NOW ALMOST EVERYONE RECOGNIZES THIS MOVIE FOR WHAT IT TRULY IS - A MASTERPIECE OF STORYTELLING."
" Rita Hayworth & the Shawshank Redemption
",spoiler,"I never saw this film on the silver screen. I didn't want to see it on video either.The video store owner implored me to watch it and I remember my emphatic reply. ""I'm not watching a 3 hour film about a prison con doing tax returns for the guards"". Fortunately for me, this video store owner was a mightily persistent sort and I begrudgingly walked home not knowing that I had just rented the greatest film ever made.This film received no hype nor the mega-bucks publicity given to a lot of movie trash out there. Because they didn't need to - all they needed to do was to let people watch it because word of mouth is the best marketing ticket in town. And so it proved.The movie is long and relies on a storyline which has been covered many times. Wrongful conviction, brutality in jail, justice in the end. But it is the way in which the story is told and acted out that defines it, quite rightly, as IMDb's top ranked film.I don't care for Stephen King as an author but his vivid imagination coupled with his skill at telling a story (a short story in this case) is top drawer. We have a man (Dufresne) who after being convicted wrongfully for murder, uses his accounting skills in jail solely to survive. Red (Freeman), the man who can ""get things"" befriends him. The story then slowly unravels with shocking scenes of brutality intertwined with flickers of how the human spirit can overcome the most hazardous odds. The Warden, Samuel Norton, is magnificent as a man whose corruption has spiralled out of control and will do almost anything to retain the status quo. Clancy Brown as the brutal guard completes the double act.The story twists and turns leaving the audience not quite knowing whether we are in for a harrowing or euphoric ending. And when the ending comes on that Mexican Beach you can almost hear the triumphant cheers ringing around the cinema halls.This is film making at its very best and it is highly unlikely that Robbins and Freeman will ever better it. Its one of those few occasions where 10 stars is not nearly high enough.So if you have been living under a rock or are as sceptical as I was in the early 90's, then it's time for me to adopt my friendly video store owners guise and say ""Watch this - its the best film ever made""."
" My #1
",,"I was reluctant to see this movie - thought it was just another prison movie - and I was certainly tired of mindless violence. I was channel surfing one evening - and stumbled across this movie. I watched a few minutes, thinking I would change channels at the first commercial. Almost 2 hours later - after seeing the end - I sat there...saying ""Wow"". That was a great movie. I have since recommended it to friends and family...it has grown in popularity due to word of mouth - and certainly deserves its spot at the top. Morgan Freeman put on a masterful performance, as did Tim Robbins. The way their friendship develops and the interplay with the other inmates - a wonderful story.If you have not watched this movie yet - put preconceived notions aside, sit down, and enjoy the journey!"
" One of the best movies ever made.
",spoiler,"There have been many cases in film history when a film is terrific do to the actors. Then there are some films are great because of what was written. With The Shawshank redemption, IMDb's favorite film, in works in both cases. The acting is superb, and the film is incredibly well written and very justified.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrense, a banker who has been accused of murdering his wife and her lover. So he is sent to Shawshank prison, where he experience's lots of things. He forms a bond with Red(played terrificly by Morgan Freeman). The warden(played by Bob Gunton) hates him. He is raped. And all of this is leading to his escape after being in there for over twenty years.The Shawshank redemption, which is based on a shot story by Stephen King, is one of the most interesting films ever made. It'a also one of the best films ever made too. What is one way to tell: When you hear Morgan Freeman's narration, you know you're in good hands.The acting is explosive. Everyone does such a good job. The Shawshank redemption is a little long, but the length is tolerable. Mainly because from the opening scene the film has you hooked. Morgan Freeman gives the better performance of the two, but the duo of Robbins and Freeman is once in a lifetime.The Shawshank redemption was an Oscar upset. It was nominated for seven, including Best picture, Best actor(Morgan Freeman) and best writing. And it lost best picture to Forrest Gump, which is also a great movie. 94 was the year of Pulp fiction also. Another Oscar upset. I prefer Pulp fiction, but The Shawshank redemption is still one of the best films ever made.The Shawshank redemption:A+"
" My favorite movie of all time
",spoiler,"This is a very, very, very, great film. It's my all time favorite. First of all the acting is f**king great. My favorite actor in the entire film is easily Morgan Freeman. He should have won that Oscar! The fact that he didn't is a f**king disgrace. Now the music to this movie is not to memorable but is still great and sets the mood for the film. Now the story line is brilliant. Andy Dufresne is accused of the murder of the wife and her secret lover, so he is sentenced to Shawshank State Prison. There he develops a friendship with a prisoner named Red. The sets in this movie are great. As expected. So in the end this is a great movie and you should really check it out."
" Good for the spirit
",spoiler,"Stephen King's novella is a damn good yarn. The narrative is always engrossing, the source elements of Andy's secret are carefully placed without exciting attention, and you are delighted when events pan out as they do.Then Darabont adapts it, and a damn good yarn becomes something special. Part of this is the adaptation - a sensitive simplification, part of it is the casting, which is pitch perfect (Morgan Freeman's Red was always an Irish redhead when I read the story - now I can't read it without seeing Morgan Freeman). And most of it, I think, is the direction.The story unfolds in unhurried fashion, with us being unsure of Andy's guilt for much of the movie, but with a gradually building sense of injustice at the way those in power in the system can treat him (and others) unfairly. The secret doesn't come at the end, but at about the three quarters mark, and brings with it a huge emotional kick. And then the story is allowed to make its own way into a gentle and perfect end.This is, without any doubt, one of the most spiritually uplifting films I have ever seen."
" The Epitome of film Excellence.
",spoiler,"I always define films as an artistic medium for a person to immerse himself to a place full of positivity and hope in an unending hymn. And for generation after generation there's only one film that I will always give praise for, finally giving a masterpiece that successfully delivers that thought. A film called The Shawshank Redemption.Never has been before the film came out, illustrates the triumph of human spirit behind any hardship in the most moving manner until this inspiring film. It's powerful in every way, that for me it brought back the real definition of an excellent film which is ""a great story with great characters"".Mainly about Andy Duferne (Tim Robbins) a skilled banker who was convicted for murdering his wife and her third party who's a pro golfer. Duferne, sentenced for double life imprisonment was sent to the notorious and sullen looking Shawshank prison to serve his sentence. While counting his days inside, several events happened to Andy. Meeting ""the sisters "" was one of his hardships he needed to go thorough, as they sexually assault selected prisoners like him, which made his stay harder and longer than he thought. One day, he also met Ellis Redding (Morgan Freeman) who was literally known to get things and run it through the walls of the prison, as Andy asked him for a hammer. Unknown to Andy, Redding had his bet on him earlier, as the first one amongst the newest batch of inmates to break down. Subtlety, the two became prison buds as the days became months and the months became years. The two almost stick together the whole time of their stay. They conversed things about the realities of prison. Which at times they contradicted at each other's opinion for Andy had always been the ""hopeful dreamer"" and Redding with his face of realism.The story soon evolves into great circumstances in favor of Andy, in spite of being a workhorse inside the prison, exploited by several police and the warden himself for his skill of handling money, Andy through his skill, will, and hope proved that there were great things waiting to happen for those who hoped and wait. For he always believed that HOPE is a great thing, that everyone should always have.The Shawshank Redemtion is a film for the ages. Its beauty as a whole will never fade as it is one of those greatest films that show an almost tangible message to fathom. It is substance over style at the end of the day. And what it evokes is what matters which leaves you moved and some even satisfied for every tear that they shed from an abundance of happiness gave by a magnificent piece of literature.It's the best film I've seen and it will always be carved to the bank of triumphant feeling.Truly excellent, 10/10."
" Luck is good but Hope is better
",,"Hi, I heard details about this movie first time two years ago from a friend. Before that in some movie channels I used to see the title been shown but never saw it. A jail movie....slow..not for me.I was in college those days in the nineties. In 2007 when my friend told me that whenever he feel sad or down he thinks of this movie and moves on. I replied back 'for me its rocky', he asked if I have seen it and when I told him that I did not, the only answer he had was it..watch it and then compare it. Now in 2009 with the recession going on, lots of trouble in work and tensions of home and personal life for me. While changing channels, I chanced upon this movie which had started and I had lost some ten minutes. I did not change the channels later and saw it in complete. The only reaction was tears in my eyes in the end and called my family and close friends. It was a shaking experience, and I got my answer....I needed to get out of my jail. I sent mails to my friends about the movie and review, few had seen it already and many did not. Result, more people watched it...and guess what I for the first time rated in this website for the movie. ..AND i expect some of my friends also did it. This is the reason why after 15 years this movie is still alive because of its human spirit story....with more followers than fans. I hope that answers some of your doubts...... This movie is for those who are busy dying......and now know its important to get busy living."
" A masterpiece.
",,"I am so happy to see this film top 1 in IMDb. It deserves to be there. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" appears in 1994, I think this year was full of amazing pictures. It lost Oscars but gained recognition. This is a great story about friendship and redemption. Frank Darabont's best movie for sure. Andy Dufresne is one of the greatest characters ever made in the cinema art. A guy who is innocent and get punished. This film shows us that even our intention is a crime in a legal world. No one is perfect, and no one can predict anything. We live by a scheme and trying to be fair. People will always make mistakes and the greatest thing is to learn from them. I am waiting for movies which can touch me like this one but after the year 2000 nothing close to that appears. There were great films about life and stuff but still, it's a modification, a copy thereof what was before. I think until the year 2000 most of the valuable things in film art was told. It's a little sad but this kind of art will always be deep in my heart as a lesson and beauty how fantastic picture man create. I hope there will be at least couple movies in my short life that leave so many emotions like ""The Shawshank Redemption"". In XXI century it is a very hard thing to do. I am patient and have positive thinking that cinema didn't say the last words."
" A must to see movie for everyone that carries a heart
",,"It is year 2009 and yet this movie is still the best movie I have ever seen. It truly and rightfully deserves to be the best movie of all times. Story telling, acting, directing, anything that you can imagine about a movie is so perfectly done. I believe everyone will have his own message from the movie but if you want to see a movie that tells how important the role of hope in our life is, you are at the correct address. The atmosphere in the prison, the way people feel and the way all these things were put together in a two hours movie; there is nothing to say. It is just exceptionally plain good. A must to see movie for everyone that carries a heart."
" Shawshank never won best picture one of the greatest crimes at the Oscars in History
",,"I was literally HOOKED. No wonder this film is rated amongst the best ever. This is definitely one of the best movies you will see your entire life. Morgan Freeman's narration was awesome. Tim Robbins powerfully illustrates the importance of HOPE. All the characters did a superb job. This is surely one of my all time favourite movies. Its a classic & a true masterpiece of cinema... Don't think! Just watch & savour it.I saw the following comment by someone and thought of adding it to mine, I agree 100% to everything of the following: ""Many people in this world are unhappy. Most people in this world don't want to be unhappy. Lots of people wish, pray and above all hope for that magic wand to wave and wash them of their fears, losses, angers and pains once and for all. They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state, while they suffer. To borrow the words of another film, they're watching the bluebirds flying over the rainbow. Many unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesn't exist. They're not destined to join the bluebirds and fairy tales don't come true. It's not that no one lives happily ever after, it's just that they're not going to. They're busy dying.In this film, or as some people have quite correctly said, this fairytale, magic wands exist. And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense imitating Houdini. However this film is not about him. Neither is it about the prison, the governor, the guard, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, the script, the direction or the score. It's about Red. He is the one who has become institutionally unhappy, he's not only trapped in a prison, not only has he given up on the idea of ever leaving, not only does he have no hope, he knows that if the miracle would ever happen to him, he couldn't cope. He's safe in his unhappiness and that security is what keeps him going. Hope is, as Red say, dangerous. The metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and I know that a rather large number of people suffer from it. A large proportion of those don't understand what's wrong, but they certainly can recognise a fellow sufferer. Those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely don't understand what's going on in those who do. They're too busy living.""Just a little piece of advice to everyone who hated/disliked this film; Believe me this film is made for multiple viewings...Don't hate this after viewing it once or twice, give it at least more than 2 viewings before you make up your mind. I'm POSITIVE it will become more and more better after each viewing and probably you will end up loving it. If not, maybe it was just not your Cup Of Tea. I hope this film satisfies everyone and I really don't care if its No.1 on the IMDb or outside Top250. Its not fair to hate a film because your favourite is not above it in the rankings!Its a deeply satisfying movie that makes you understand the importance of HOPE.9.8/10P.S. Technically{all round film-making} it may not be the greatest movie of all-time{that honor can go to Godfather/LOTR:ROTK/Star Wars 4,etc.} BUT it certainly goes down in my book as one of the finest and a movie to savour for ages."
" The Shawshank Redemption Is An Excellent Film
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is an excellent film from director Frank Darabont whose admirable in making this story based on a book by Stephen King. Tim Robbins gives a great performance as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman is equally impressive as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding two imprisoned men looking for redemption who bond after many years while dealing with not only the abusive corrupt prison guards but the violent fellow prisoners amongst them as well. Robbins and Freeman had good chemistry together which made their growing friendship that much more believable on the screen. The rest of the cast including Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The pacing was a little slow at times and the running time of 142 minutes made the film feel a bit long but the rest made up for it's few flaws. Overall despite it's flaws The Shawshank Redemption is definitely a must see a movie that can't be missed. It has a compelling story, character development, drama, some humor, and exceptional performances by the cast (especially Robbins and Freeman) who make this one of the best books by Stephen King that was made into a movie. Well done. Much better than expected."
" The Best Film Ever Made
",,"Seriously, if ever there's a film that people should be forced to watch, it's this. The acting in it is truly perfect, the storyline in very, very well written and the ending is one of the cleverest (and most misleading) endings I have ever witnessed. This film can (and will) be enjoyed by people of all ages (relatively - check parents guide for suitability), and will keep you in suspense for the full duration. Unlike in most other Hollywood films, the twists in the storyline are very well executed and it is in no ways cheesy or cheap. Morgan Freeman gives the performance of his life without making his fellow actors over-act. The Shawshank Redemption blows every other prison dramas out of the water. See it at all costs."
" Phenomenal Movie!
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most touching and greatest movies I have ever seen. The movie is based on the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King. Unlike most of his novels King didn't write a horror story but instead a inspiring tale of hope in unlikely places. Overseeing the transition from book to big screen is Frank Darabont who in his director debut scores a home run with this movie.Not only does the plot pull you in but the actors do as well. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do a fantastic job as the 2 central characters and as friends. Bob Gunton is great in the part of the villain as the evil warden. The directing, cast, and plot all combine to make the movie awesome.The plot of the movie revolves around Andy Dufresne a man who is imprisoned for life for a crime he did not commit. Over time Andy becomes friends with Red an inmate who runs the business of smuggling in things into the prison. The story then follows the 2 and how they handle prison life.Years go by but Andy continues to speak of hope. Ultimately Andy will commit unbelievable acts in a touching story that is truly inspirational. The message the story delivers is to never give up hoping. The climax of the movie is fantastic and the ending is one of the greatest in film history.Overall the Shawshank Redemption remains one of the greatest films of all time."
" My Favourite Movie Of All Time
",spoiler,"This is beyond doubt my favourite movie of all-time. I am a Morgan Freeman fan and apart from Driving Miss Daisy, i have loved all his movies that i have seen. The Shawshank Redemption stands above all. I think it is a great movie with a sad overall story but a happy and just ending. The only other prison movie i like as much is the classic Clint Eastwood movie Escape from Alcatraz. The Shawshank Redemption has long been my favourite movie and even though i have the DVD, i still watch when it is on TV. 15 years since its release and i still haven't seen anything i like more. I would recommend this movie to everyone and if you haven't seen it yet, you must be living in a cave or something. If you are in a cave, get out and go see this fantastic movie. 10/10"
" Wow!!
",spoiler,"When Shawshank begins, for about the first two minutes it seems nothing more than a made-for-TV movie. However, as the story progresses you find out how amazing it really is. Yet how can a film that contains rape, beatings and suicide make you feel so good at the end? Frank Darabont manages to do this so well. The Green Mile gives you a warm feeling at the ending, but not like this does. I just love the way it follows the subplot of Brooks right up until he kills himself. How touching that was to see an old man, let out of prison but without routine. He belonged in prison, not in the outside world.You forget at times that you are watching a movie. It sucks you in and moves you. If you haven't seen Shawshank you have missed out on one of the finest movies ever made. But don't worry - you're not beyond redemption! Watch it!"
" Life has never been more beautiful!
",,"This movie is one that gives to wit the most part of being happy in this life. It is true that you might not be lucky enough in life but even in the midst of crap, even when all your life has crumbled over your face, hope is still your last hope.One night he caught his wife cheating and was thrown in jail for a murder that he had not committed and after all that he got raped! What would you have done had you been in his shoes? keep on hoping? Well, Andy not only had hope, he gave hope to his fellow prisoners. The brilliant Morgan Freeman gives the cherry on the top in this movie and if he weren't in this movie, the movie would have lacked something for sure.There are scenes and lines that you will never forget in this movie and I have commented on hundreds of movies but very few I gave the full 10 out of 10 and this movie is one of those few."
" Too Good
",spoiler,This movie has many stories to tell. Every scene has its own story. I like the way Morgan freeman narrates in the movie which makes it all the more interesting. The scene where Andy gets beer for his coworkers. Also when he plays the two Italian singers on prison radio. Brooks last few days.And how Red comes to terms with his freedom. I recently watched it for the first time and can't believe how i could miss this for so long. I Also cant believe Morgan never won Oscar for this. I cant think of any better performance than this.Truly deserves the number one spot. Since last week i have watched it 3 times and plan to watch it again. Thank you Frank Darabont for giving us hope.
" The greatest movie I've ever seen
",spoiler,"I'll admit, I'd held off on seeing the Shawshank Redemption. I remained a little apprehensive; was this film as great as the masses of IMDb and particularly world wide were saying? From the moment I began watching this film to the very end, I was kept completely in awe at how beautiful and amazing this film is.The Shawshank Redemption is a film set in a US Prison, following the story of Andy Dufrense who was sent to Shawshank for a crime in which he did not forget. Here, he meets Ellis ""Red"" Redding (played by Morgan Freeman) an aged convict who, unlike the majority of the populace, accepts that he is a guilty man. The two develop a friendship over the lasting years, which evolves into what could be akin to brotherhood.The message of hope in this film is as inspirational as it is an interesting concept. Despite being convicted, Andy undertakes a quest to become a free man once more, even if it means breaking the laws and, as shown later in the film, breaking out of ShawshankThe acting in this film is simply outstanding. Morgan Freeman, providing both a character and the narration of said character, portrays his character in such a convincing way that one can't help but feel moved by his dialogue. Bob Gunton, who plays Warden Norton (an immensely corrupt individual), passes himself off in such a brilliant performance that I couldn't help but feel pure anger for the Warden throughout the movie.But perhaps what makes this movie so beautiful is the underlying messages. Despite being incarcerated for life without parole, Andy maintains hope, despite what the others say when he freely speaks of it. The evolving friendship of Red and himself delivers the message that not all criminals are rabid beasts, and that friendship can outlast the grim depression of a prison. Though I am by no means proud to admit it, I felt myself become watery-eyed several times throughout the film, particularly the letter sent by Brooks before he commits suicide, climaxing in a tragic, heart-breaking scene.Wherever you are in the world, you must see this movie. It will most certainly change your life. It did mine."

" A Sort of Secular Redemption
",,"The story of this film takes place over a twenty-year period between 1947 and 1967. Andy Dufresne, a young banker from Portland, Maine, is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and sentenced to life imprisonment. (""Shawshank"" is the name of the prison where he serves his sentence). The prison is a brutal place, and Andy is frequently beaten and sexually assaulted by a gang of homosexual inmates called ""The Sisters"". Two things, however, help him to survive. One is his friendship with another convict, Red, who has a reputation for being able to acquire almost any item and, for a price, to smuggle it into the prison. The other is his financial expertise, which he puts to good use, becoming a tax and financial adviser to the prison guards and even the Warden himself. As a reward for these services, Andy is given a privileged job in the prison library and protection from molestation. To avenge their attacks on Andy, the leader of the ""Sisters"" is so badly beaten by the guards that he is crippled for life; Andy is not molested again.The Warden devises a scheme under which inmates are put to work on local construction projects. The purpose of this is ostensibly to prepare them for life after they are released, but in reality he is exploiting their free labour for his own personal profit, and using Andy's financial skills to launder the proceeds. This arrangement seems to work to Andy's advantage, because of the extra privileges he is granted, but things change when a new young prisoner named Tommy Williams is sent to Shawshank. Tommy has evidence that could secure Andy's release; a former cellmate in another prison has confessed to him that he committed the murders for which Andy was convicted. Tommy confides this secret to the Warden who, fearing that his illegal schemes will be revealed should Andy ever be released, arranges to have Tommy murdered by a corrupt guard.There is a long history of American prison films, including the likes of ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"", ""Cool Hand Luke"", ""Brubaker"" and the more recent ""The Last Castle"". (Frank Darabont was later to direct another prison film, ""The Green Mile"", based, like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" on a Stephen King story). Most of these were made with a liberal social agenda in mind, aiming to expose the harsh prison conditions and thereby inspire their reform. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" falls, to some extent, within this tradition; it is made from a basically liberal viewpoint and vividly depicts the brutality of prison life, although the fact that it is a period piece, set several decades in the past, might suggest that social issues were not the filmmakers' sole concern. Perhaps more important are the analysis of the nature of freedom and of the relationship between Andy and Red.The word ""prison"", from the French ""pris"" (""taken""), merely indicates a place where captives are held, and the authorities, especially in America, prefer to describe many prisons by some more positive term such as ""penitentiary"" or ""reformatory"" which implies their purpose of rehabilitating criminals. Shawshank, a prison where the Warden and guards are at least as crooked as the inmates, has precisely the opposite effect. Andy goes in innocent of any crime and comes out guilty of being an accessory to corruption and fraud. Yet, despite his involvement in the Warden's dishonesty, Andy retains a certain integrity; he refuses to give up hope and refuses to allow himself to be beaten by the system. Although he is in prison he has found a sort of freedom. A key moment comes when he defies the guards to play a Mozart aria over the prison loudspeakers for all the inmates to hear- a reminder of spiritual values even in the harshest of environments.Red faces a different problem. He fears that he has become so institutionalised that he will be unable to survive freedom, as happened to another long-term prisoner who committed suicide shortly after his release. In prison, his role as the ""fixer"" who can obtain anything, be it a packet of cigarettes, a rock hammer or a poster of Rita Hayworth, makes him the king of the inmates. (These latter two items will play an important role in the plot). On the outside he will be just another ex-con trying to make ends meet in a dead-end job. Paradoxically, he is more free in jail than he will be on the outside. I won't give away the ending, but it involves Andy repaying Red's previous kindnesses by showing him how he can be free in all senses of the word.The film was not a great box office success when first released but has since acquired a status as one of the classics of the modern American cinema; it has now supplanted ""The Godfather"" as number one on IMDb's Top 250 list. The film would perhaps not be number one on my personal list, but it is a fine one and would certainly be in my top 250, perhaps the top 100. Its two stars, Tim Robbins as Andy and Morgan Freeman as Red, are both excellent. Its initial lack of success may have had something to do with its rather clumsy title. ""Shawshank"" is not a word that will mean anything to the average person (according to one story Darabont was once asked how his ""rickshaw"" film was going) and ""redemption"", except in technical legal contexts, normally has a religious connotation. This is not an explicitly religious film; indeed, in its portrayal of Warden Norton as a sanctimonious, Bible-bashing hypocrite, it can be seen as critical of religion. Nevertheless, the word ""redemption"" is perhaps appropriate in this context, after undergoing the hell of Shawshank Andy and Red manage to find a sort of secular redemption. It may be this message of hope that accounts for the film's continuing popularity. 9/10"
" One of My Top 10 of All Time
",,"This is without a doubt one of the finest films of the last 20 years. I think that if it had been released with more fanfare and didn't have such great competition that year, it might have won for Best Picture. This film has such a powerful presence that it has a life of it's own apart from the cast, score, cinematography, etc., all of which are deservedly great. This is one of those movies that you can switch to when you are channel surfing, and stop and watch the rest of it, no matter what part of the movie you are at. Perhaps The Godfather and Jaws are a couple of others that do that for me, and it never gets old, no matter how many times you watch it. One thing that disappoints me regarding this film is what has happened to the director, Frank Darabont. Unfortunately, he has never come close to achieving the greatness of Shawshank with his subsequent films. I thought The Green Mile was good, but it didn't hold a candle to Shawshank. I was also very disappointed in The Mist. I sincerely hope that he is able to recapture some of the magic of Shawshank Redemption in a future film, because he definitely does have the proved ability to do so."
" get busy living or get busy dying
",,"In short supply are the movies which act as cathartic catalysts on a second –or-plus viewing as compellingly and strongly as on the first viewing. The other night, overpowered by feelings of despondency and ennui, I went to flick through my small collection of movies and on an impulse I picked up The Shawshank Redemption. I savored every moment of the movie even more than my first time a couple of years ago. I chalk it up to its beautifully crafted story, its virtuoso and powerhouse performances, and its underlying themes of hope, resolve, and ultimate salvation. This time, in his feature directorial debut Frank Darabont has tapped into the wellspring of King the horrible's and fashioned a juggernaut of a prison drama out of his novella Rita Hayworth and the shawshank Redemption. This movie stands out among other prison flicks in that it flies in the face of conventions. Contrary to our expectations and cheapened tastes, Shawshank does not intend to explore the horrors of prison life as its fulcrum but the way its inhabitants clutch at straws and pull out all stops to extricate themselves from the shackles of the gloom of their claustrophobic mental incarceration against all the odds turns out to be its thematic pull. And the movie pulls it off big time. Among a mosaic of characters, events, shenanigans and skullduggery, the movie mainly delves into the friendship struck up between two lifers. The friendship between Andy Dufresne, played convincingly by Tim Robbins, who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to serve two concurrent lives, and the veteran Red, the brilliant Morgan Freeman, carries the emotional and inspirational mood of the movie. When a busload of prisoners arrive at the max-security state penitentiary of Shawshank, the other felons bet on who is going to burst into tears at the first night of prison life. Red ups his antes on the seemingly brittle fresh fish Andy, who was a respectable banker in the outside and is like a fish out of water among a bunch of thick-skinned miscreants. Red loses since Andy turns out to be more redoubtable and impermeable than any prison wall several feet thick. Little do the fellow prisoners realize at first glance what an enigmatic character he is. For the first months he says next to nothing, meanders through other prisoners in the prison yard minding his own business and the movie speaks through by-turn humorous, poignant and thought-provoking narration of the omniscient Red who is known for smuggling things in and charging a 20% markup for the services he provides. However, Red's omniscience is not all-encompassing and Godly enough to bore into the Sphinx-like mind of the introverted Andy even after 19 years. On a tarring occasion, he overhears a guard complaining about the taxes he has to pay for an inheritance, he screws up his courage to offer him his expert advice on tax evasion. Now, he is treated as a special guest since he cooks the books for the prisons' powers that be who have hit pay dirt. His financial legerdemain proves to be a double-edged sword. Now he is the victim of his own success. A newcomer is willing to testify to his innocence in the court but the warden regards his accountant too valuable to be expendable. Andy survives several assaults and rapes. He never gives up. He never cracks under pressure. Life is very simple to him: get busy living or get busy dying. He makes the first choice and remains true to it through thick and thin. He lives with hope as his source of salvation. The emotional pull of the movie owes a great deal to the spirited and flawless performances of all the cast members. Morgan Freeman effortlessly inhabits his character as a real free man. Tim Robbins is superlative as a quintessential embodiment of hope and inspiration. James Whitmore, as the institutionalized prison trusty who is suicidal in the outside, turns in a superlative performance. Hats off to all the performers. The Shawshank Redemption is a prime example of the gap between the box office performance of a movie and its popularity. This movie famously bombed in the box office, barely covering its budget. But overtime it gained in such popularity that it has snatched the coveted toppest ranking place in IMDb from such hot favorites and topdogs like Godfather, Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction, the last two of which eclipsed Shawshank in 1994 Academy Awards. Perhaps in 1994 the movie lacked the requisite word of mouth that it is enjoying now. All in all, Shawshank is a compulsively watchable movie with bits of pleasure withheld in every watching only to be relished on next occasions."
" Very Moving! Makes you appreciate Freedom and Friendship
",,"Very few movies that made me cry ... and (The Shawshank Redemption) is certainly one of them. I remember when I first went to see this movie in my freshman year in college. The movie made me appreciate freedom and true friendship.Very powerful picture indeed and each actor deserved an Oscar for their great performance. It is sad that the movie did not get the true scale of recognition it deserved, but being on the IMDb top 250 movies of all time based on people's votes is a great way to show the well earned appreciation.If you did not watch this movie yet, then you missed a lot!"
" The Greatest Movie Ever Made?
",,"Every time I watch The Shawshank Redemption it reinforces the fact that it is my favorite movie of all time. But certainly as entertaining a film that it is, being a personal favorite does not necessarily make it a great film or dare I saythe greatest film ever made.But what then makes a film great? First and foremost, if it sets out to entertain the general public, it must do that (and Shawshank certainly does that). Its pure entertainment value is essentially a stipulation in its inclusion in the great IMDb ""greatest movie"" debate. The serious nature of its central plot pointsa wrongly convicted murderer who assists the corrupt warden as means to affect his own escapeis contrasted by some truly funny scenes. Although by no means a comedy, the splendid screenplay is wrought with witty dialog. There's nothing fancy about this filmno special effects, spectacular scenery or even a bunch of pretty women. No, its just the telling of a story, mostly through the narration of Morgan Freeman's character, Red, that almost lulls viewers into believing that nothing really interesting or important is going to happen here. But after all of the subtle plot twists I think what makes this film great for me is I feel like I'm actually sharing in Andy's redemption. Now if that isn't what they teach in Film-making 101 then they should just close up the classroom.Ultimately, there cannot be a single motion picture that is the ""greatest film of all time"" because as art, and in an art form as varied as cinema, greatness must be measured by each individual. Greatness, as beauty, truly is in the eye of the beholder. But in this beholder's eyes I think The Shawshank Redemption is truly the greatest film I have ever seen."
" My all time best film
",,"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie."
" A harsh tale that lifts you again and again
",,"I have seen this movie a few times. Each time with the same hope and enthusiasm as before. The main story is obviously Andy's. His fears, his hopes and dreams... his struggle to remain sane. As a rock hammer, Andy chisels the prison around him. But this is more than the story of Andy and his way out of prison. It's a tale of society, men trying to survive trying to remain human and civilized. Red is a gentleman masterfully played by on of the greatest actors ever. His character adds depth to the story and makes room for hope, for friendship. All those around Andy benefit from his morals, his intelligence, his perseverance, his will not to let go of himself. At first we see men with no hope, no way out of their walls. Brooks is an unfortunate part of it. But Andy changes lives. Some study, some begin to plan life outside the walls. Even the guards look up to a man as righteous as they come. Every time I see it I get the same warm feeling as the first time I saw it without actually knowing what it was, what it is... It's only fitting it sits on top of the charts and if that makes people watch it, it's just enough as it will bring them the same feeling again and again. I movie to watch once a year or whenever you need a little ""pick-me-up""."
" The minutes glide by
",,"Despite being a very long movie, and not very action packed for that matter, I found 'The Shawshank Redemption' one of the most entertaining motion pictures I have ever stumbled upon. And I think that the entertainment value a certain film may hold is largely over-looked among film critics, and most people who watch films with a critical eye. But I hold it as probably the single most important feature in movies in most cases. And by entertainment value I do not only mean how it feels when you are watching the movie, but also the picture it leaves on your mind that makes you want to see it again, and that you can look back at and actually experience the feeling you gain from actually watching the film. And this is where 'Shawshank' really shines. The 2 hours just went by, and left me with a really good feeling after wards for some time.But the other features should not be ignored either in any case. I really like the way 'Shawshank' makes you think. For me, it was mostly about how good I actually have it, and about life in general. It really made me want to better my ways in all sorts of ways. But unfortunately it wont last forever, but that's why it's good you can see the movie again. And when you do, it will still have the same impact on you as it did the first time around."
" Simply the greatest movie ever made. Make it part of your bucket list.
",,"My story is one of fate. I went to the video store expecting to get Terminator II on laserdisc. It was out, and out of desperation to rent something, I asked for what was new. I was given the ""Shawshank Redemption"". I had never heard of it, quite honestly, but I gave it a try but was not expecting much but two hours of ""time pass"".The first time through watching it, I thought it was good. Nothing extraordinary. But something made me watch it again. And I was hooked. I can't explain it, but this movie gets better every time you watch it. I ended up watching it about 8 times in that 4 day timespan.Watch this movie, as your bucket list of things to do in life. You really have not lived till you have seen it.I admit to being completely obsessed by the movie, owning it on every medium imaginable, and having all the books and posters about it. But do not let my obsession dissuade you. I do not impress easily, but I can tell you this is simply the greatest movie ever made in cinema.Every moment and every dialog of this movie fits in perfectly to create the greatest masterpiece in American cinema."
" Hope is a good thing and good thing never dies
",,"This film (or may be masterpiece) changed the whole outlook of mine towards life. The characters played by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins were so real and so closed to my heart that I cried and I laughed with them while watching it for the first time.We learn from books, we learn from our parents, we learn from our friends and we learn from movie like ""The Shawshank Redemption"".Once upon a time, I was going through a bad phase of my life and bit depressed also. Then some suggested me to watch this. What happened next was simply miracle. The pain endured by Tim Robbins was no less than mine. But it was hope that kept him alive. That infused a new joy in my life and I achieved success in very little amount of time. The dialogues are simply straight yet touching.The movie has universal appeal - It can move anyone because characters played by Freeman and Robbins are so close to heart.Double thumbs up to Stephen King and Frank Darabont for teaming up and offering this life changing piece of cinema.This movie was not made for Oscars (although it grabbed multiple nominations) and not for critics (some critics ridicule about its number position in IMDb 250). It was made for common people like us.Humble salute to all who were directly or indirectly associated with this all time classic."
" Meaningful movie in cynical times
",spoiler,"Much has been written and praised (deservedly so) about ""The Shawshank Redemption."" The fact that it's #1 on this list gives me faith in humanity. Instead of talking about its obvious care with excellent writing, directing, editing and cinematography, I'll just say how much the film has meant to me personally. Its message of hope and, above all, perseverance, kept me going through many of life's travails. I think I responded to how it dealt with the day-to-day grind of life (albeit in dramatic fashion)and even the stress of boredom. The other thing it demonstrated was how profoundly one person can affect another without even saying much to them. After all, Andy and Red only have one true baring-their-souls conversation in 19 years together (One of the greatest scenes in the history of movies, by the way). Yet we are fully aware of how much these two meant to each other and how moved we are when they are reunited. It's a real spiritual journey (visually as well); almost like Red has died at the end (leaving Hell/Shawshank) and is reborn in Zihuatanejo (Heaven)to be rejoined with the one person who understands him. Just a marvelous, life-changing experience for me. My thanks to all who've supported and created this movie. It will live on and be remembered throughout the years as one of the pinnacles of human achievement."
" One of the best movies around
",,"This is such a good movie, that even to this day, many years after it came out, I still cannot find a single person who does not like Shawshank redemption. Everything in this film is timed well. The story is excellent and flows with perfect timing and the editing between the sequences are great. The acting is great, and it keeps you interested from the first to the last frame. It also has a very clever plot. You are not 100% sure what Tim Robbins is up to and how he has escaped until much later. Great job by everyone from director, actors to script. Just the best in movie making."
" It's the small things that make it brilliant...
",spoiler,"Why Shawshank Redemption isn't rated 9.9/10 is beyond me.What has caused me to reflect and comment on this film is the small things...99.9% of movies miss them. A movie is a photographic montage of images with sound and is meant to represent a story. Humans have always enjoyed stories from time immemorial huddled around fires in caves to modern things like FaceBook or YouTube, it's all about stories.Shawshank has many small instances that Frank Darabont included like when Red leaves a small note to Andy with a free poster when he returns from the hospital/isolation. Another small instance is when Andy gives Red the harmonica, it could easily not have been filmed but it touches everyone with its deeper meanings. It's a collage of many small instances that make it meaningful and memorable, over and over again.I am convinced that's why everyone loves this movie and watch it repeatedly, it's the small things that touch you. How many movies have given you the most important small message of all...of hope...it's the most powerful of goals we can have, hope really sets you free."
" So good, I watched it without the sound!
",,"I'm a big Stephen King fan, and I wondered if this movie would be a good adaptation. Some of King's work has been great on film, but others have not translated well. No fear. As others have noted, this is an amazing film that provides inspiration and reconnects the viewer with the inner core of humanity. The script is great, the directing is wonderful, and the performances are unbelievably good. To give you some idea of just HOW GOOD this is, the first time I saw it was on an airline. Problem was, the headset didn't work and there weren't any other headsets. The movie is so good that I couldn't stop watching it--and this is a movie heavy on dialogue. If you've never seen it, do yourself a favor. NOTE: It's even better with the sound!!!"
" One In a Million Movie
",,"Shawshank Redemption gives the feel of a strong, firm and amazing story that can move people while sitting down to watch it. The characters are memorable. Morgan Freeman as Red will always be in my head. Tim Robbins and Any Dufrense, is amazing as well. Shawshank gives the audience a taste of a perfect movie. Movies like this don't come often. Movies come with strong stories, but acting, and flow of this story can mess it up. Shawshank doesn't disappoint. The acting is superb, and the flow of the story is unforgettable. Based on the Stephen King novel, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, I'd say this is one of the movies where the film triumphs over the novel. The film also brings a sense of humor, which is a very good tool for films like these, because if everything is serious, it's very possible that it might be killed. Well, people have their own opinion. One scene amazes me, and probably is one of my favorite scenes in the film is when the prisoners are watching Gilda, and they're all waiting for Rita Hayworth to do the thing with her hair. It still makes me laugh and pleased, with the acting and reactions of the prisoner, and the beauty of Rita Hayworth herself. Shawshank Redemption is a one-of-a-kind film, where stories come in, and the film enlarges the story and puts it into a whole new level. The excellent acting, and a great adapted screenplay makes this movie one of the greatest films ever in history."
" Simply the best!!!

Well it was released when i was very young i could find time to see it only now., and i still feel i should have seen this movie long before!! ITS WORTH EVERY SECOND GUYS!!!Don't Miss It!!ITS THE BEST!!!"

Great performances (Tim Robbins & Freeman Qualifying as one my favorite actors). The whole presentation has been very apt to the movie. But what is important is the strong message this movie transcends, i.e. of Hope, is truly recommendable.This movie deserves an intent watch by ""all"". Do take you some time off to watch the movie,if not twice, be it once."
" In my top ten

I could rave about it until I'm blue in the face, but I'll spare you (and myself) that. I must have watched it over a dozen times now, and with every viewing I still get as caught up in it as I did the first time I saw it. For me, that's one of the marks of a special film. I'm don't really want to use the term 'uplifting' yet again, but it is the best way to describe it. Highly recommended."
" Excellent cinema, right out of the heart
",spoiler,"When you look at IMDb's top 250 you see many famous and ambitious films like Star Wars, The Godfather, The Lord of the Rings and others. Not saying that these movies are bad (they are actually quite brilliant) they were made famous because of the publicity and the abilities these films had in the time. Star Wars started the sci-fi age, The Godfather made people interested in the secret society of the Mafia and Lord of the Rings brought life into the fantasy genre again. But what really made these sublime films so popular was the publicity and the fantastic special effects which costed certain amounts of money. In 1994 Frank Darabont decided to have a go on one of Stephen King's novels, not knowing what would happen. They made a film that is honest and that contains (on the contrary to Star Wars etc.) a vital lesson, a meaning and a message to all who watch it.This movie is redefining cinema. No explosions. No heart-stopping excitement. No, it's pure poetry, music and sublime acting. The overwhelming and intriguing story introduces banker Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) who was falsely convicted for a double life sentence in the heavily guarded establishment of Shawshank Prison. His life must go on and he makes friends with other inmates like Red (wonderfully acted out by Morgan Freeman) and Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore brings tears to your eyes). Warden Norton (played immensely evil by Bob Gunton) and Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown) don't make Andy's life comfortable in the prison, but with Andy's unique skills he manages to win their attention and gratitude.This film has some terrific moments like the helicopter shot over the Shawshank Prison and the stunningly beautiful scene where Andy locks himself up in the Warden's office and plays Mozart to all the inmates. Morgan Freeman's raw voice makes this moment more powerful than any other moment in any other movie I ever saw. At the release of the film, people criticised the film harshly and wasn't a big hit, certainly not at the box-office. But when the film appeared in the stores it became an enormous hit. And until this day, for over 4-5 years now I believe, it stands on the second place in the top 250, one place away from The Godfather.This is a film you have to see once in your life!"
" Inspiration perfected
",spoiler,"To be honest, I enjoy reading a good novel more than watching a film. You usually get far more character development than in a movie (e.g. Puzo's The Godfather).But not with Shawshank. This is the closest thing film has to a perfect story. The characters, pacing, plot, monologues and every other element contribute to an inspirational yarn with a fulfilling ending. Brook's suicide is the only film scene that has ever moved me to tears, and if you watch just one film in your life - let it be this. Not a film which others have tried to mimic for a good box office, e.g. LOTR: The Return of the King, The Godfather, but an original, stand-alone film that, in my opinion, will never be surpassed in quality"
" Not Just Another Prison Film......
",,"I was at the video store with my girlfriend and we wanted to rent out a few movies. I decided that one of the films we should rent out is 'The Shawshank Redemption'. I had always wondered why it had such good ratings as well as being positioned at #2 in the IMDb Top 250, and I thought I would see just how good the movie really was.When the film concluded in a way that I would have never conceded, I sat there in front of the TV surprised and dumbfounded. When my girlfriend asked me what was wrong, I simply just said ""That....is the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life."" It was not just an ordinary and clichéd film I was watching, it was art on the screen, 2 and a half hours of extraordinary cinematography, unforgettable acting, and a plot so compelling, that you just did not want it to end. Morgan Freeman as Red and Tim Robbins as Andy are the perfect choices for their respective roles. The prison setting is so daunting and visually satisfying, while the corruption by the warden and the guards is dreadfully brutal yet extraordinarily eye popping. I normally dislike some movies that normally go for over 2 hours as I think they are just dragging on, but Shawshank along with very few others kept me glued to the screen in suspense. I hung onto every scene and every word uttered in the entire film.'The Shawshank Redemption' is unique in its own little way, and it has affirmed my belief that hope and courage through adversity is possible and rewarding. Not many movies are made like this, and I just hope that there is a movie like, but probably not as good as, 'The Shawshank Redemption' that will be made in this hostile and cruel 21st Century. Movies like this really change lives.10/10"

I can't think of anyone who doesn't like this movies, young, old, male, female and over the entire globe! Good Work!

The relationship between Tim Burton and the rest of his jail-mates can be touching but also horrible and with some violence. This is a great ""feelgood"" movie about hope, love, hate and freedom!"

At the tender age of 14, when I started to understand the complexity of human emotion I was introduced to this beautiful film. I remember the first time I sat and viewed the film, my father put the VHS in the video player and left me alone to begin my relationship with this film, from the age of 14 I reckon I must have watched this old film twice a year since and every time I still think this is probably the best film I have ever seen.Just thought I'd express a little of how I feel about this film, hope you don't mind.Al"

" Why the ending is so moving
",spoiler,"I myself, like most people, love this movie and whenever it got to the end where you see Andy and Red smiling and embracing on the beach it always sent chills through my soul, but I realized that in addition to that sequence, where not a word is spoken between the two men, it's that 'deep blue ocean' that makes the ending so dramatic. I think with the exception of a few outdoor scenes in the movie where you see a little sky, the bulk of the movie is shot in the drab gray tones of prison (cause prison is drab and gray), so when that BIG BLUE OCEAN hit's your eyes, it makes the whole experience of their freedom and the fact that they never gave up hope that much more dramatic.Hope is definitely a good thing and quite possibly, the best of ALL things."

" A modern masterpiece
",spoiler,"Andy (superb Tim Robbins) is condemned to stay all his life in prison due to two murders he has not done. There, he will meet Red (Morgan Freeman, impressive, these is one of the best relation love/friendship of all the movies I've ever seen). Red understand perfectly Andy and guides him at the first moments, as we see Andy from Red's eyes, his loyalty and admiration. We understand all these only by his looks and his moves, in one of the best parts of Freeman. Robbins play the part of a distant character, brave, righteous, intelligent, but as everyone, weak, frightened. It's like an angel in the depht of hell. The hardness of the prison and the corruption of the prison system is perfectly told to us by Darabont perfectly. Its realism is sometimes disgusting and the hardest scenes touches you at the depht of your heart. The film has a very high dramatic part, but in any moment becomes too sweety. Its wonderful dialogues, its magnificent study of characters and their psychologies, the charisma of Robbin's character, well absolutely everything helps that this film becomes part of the selected group of every time masterpieces. There are two scenes that I've loved a lot. The one where, Andy is able to listen, relaxed to a Mozart's Opera in the director prison's office (although being in prison, at that moment, Andy is free). And the other where, one of the prisoners, being very old and having spend almost all his life in prison, commits suicide as he cannot get used to a life in freedom. However, despite all the hardness and the few holes to hope that there's in the movie, at the end there's always a little ray of light. The Shawshank Redemption is that, a chant for life, for our dreams... a masterpiece."
" 10 out of 10
",,"This is one of the best movies about ""friendship"" I've ever seen, also one of the best prison movies. I found it better than Robert Redford's ""CASTLE"". Morgan Freeman was perfect as usual and I can say that Tim Robbins reached the top of his performance and also his career. I wish this couple come together for another movie, the kind of it is not important I'm sure the spectators will have the same taste as before. I watched most of the films of Morgan Freeman and I can say this was the best of his, normally he prefers to play in films like ""Seven"",""Kiss the girls"",""Along came a spider"",... but I think he should think again that which kind of his films stay at the top of the charts..."
" Incredibly Powerful Film
",spoiler,"Undoubtedly one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The outstanding performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman left me with feelings so profound of being in that prison with them. Be warned that the first half of the film is visually and psychologically confronting.The film deals with fundamental themes of friendship and hope whilst delivering some very powerful social commentary. I am left questioning the state of our justice system. We lock away these ""threats to society"", alienate them and subject them to the most hostile and unnatural of environments. Then when they have served their life terms, we throw them back into society with the expectation for them to live normally and abide by values never once upheld or taught in their filthy prison cells. The Shawshank Redemption tells a very powerful story. A story that made me laugh and cry. It ignited just about every human emotion I could possibly experience in just over a two hour period of time.A truly amazing film, 10 out of 10 from me!"
" Excellent Film. A Powerful Drama
",,"Ten Thumbs Up if I had them. Incredible story, incredible cast. I would rate this as probably the best film I have ever seen and I have probably seen it a hundred times on cable. I would have to say this would be Morgan Freemans best performance out of all of his films. There should have been an Oscar for him. This film definitely beat out ""Million Dollar Baby"" for which he ultimately and finally received his first Oscar. The Academy wasn't all there when ""Shawshank"" deserved its due. Robbins played a great part in this film and did an excellent job however Freeman carried the film. A true drama that shows the bond of two people in horrible circumstances. Yes, this one is one to own, if you don't have it...buy it. You wont be disappointed."
" A great movie!
",,"What I can say is this is a really great movie. It tells use there exists brightness in the darkness and never gives up hope. You will succeed in the end. And also be ready at any time.Maybe it is because of language problem, I don't grasp it very well in the beginning. But step by step, I understand it. And in the end, I understand it and especially the result is out of my expectation that doesn't happened in the movies I have ever seen in the past. And also the performance skill is another thing I like it. They are good actors. And this is the movies that seldom take man-women sensation as topic, but still give people good feelings.Great movie encourage you while entertaining you!"
" How would you define ""human""?
",,"You'd certainly have to be over a certain age to watch this movie. Not because it contains small amounts of very realistic and believable violence (kids are used to that nowadays) but very much so because of the psychological impact it could have. Forget horror ... if I was a kid and had seen this movie it would completely alter my perception of humanity, given I would understand it. Once beyond that certain age this movie will impress you, to say the least.Shawshank Redemption places a man in the wrong place, at the wrong time (early 1900's) and in the worst kind of scenario. He's convicted of the murder of his wife and sentenced to life imprisonment. This is how the movie starts. From this point on the majority of the scenes will take place in the Shawshank Prison Facility.Logicly, as a viewer, you side for the Andy Dufresne (beautifly interpreted by Tim Robbins). It doesn't really matter whether you think he did it or not ... he's stuck in there and it looks like he'll be there for a while. Friendships are born and enemies are made, as you would expect. The way this movie maintains a thrilling storyline describing the friendships, however, is stunning. At the receiving end of one of those friendships is 'Red' Redding (Morgen Freeman), a fellow inmate. 'Red' can get you anything and as Andy, 'Red' is serving a life sentence. Let's just say they have the time to get to know each other, learn from each other and eventually save each other.Because of the limited scenery the story and acting performance gets all the attention it deserves. If I had to condense this movie into a few words, ""intelligence, justice, friendship, being human, redemption"" would all sound like understatements. Saying anything more about this masterpiece would spoil your viewing experience. It's just one you'll have to watch if you love movies."
" One of my favourites...
",,"*******MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD**********The story begins with the court case of Andy dufresne for the alleged murder of his wife and her lover (the first few minutes at the start captivate you from the beginning)Andy is wrongly convicted and sent to Shawshank maximum security prison set with a double life sentence.Andy finds a new companion called Red(Morgan Freeman) the man who can get things for anyone in the prison for the right price. As a person that can get things or has been known to locate things from time to time for somebody Red doesn't find it particularly odd that andy asks him if he can get him Rita Hayworth in 1949.Of course he accepts.The line that defines this great piece of cinema is ""get busy living or get busy dying"".This movie is without a doubt one of my favourites and remember always- FEAR CAN HOLD YOU PRISONER HOPE CAN SET YOU FREE!"
" Hope Springs Eternal:Rita Hayworth And The Shawshank Redemption.
",spoiler,"After just seeing this,i have to say i think its one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story.And one of the few films that can be called a ""moden classic"". The Plot:After the police in Maine find the bodies of a married woman and her lover,who were shot eight times.They bring in the married woman's husband.A hot-shot banker Andy Dufren(Tim""The Mystic River"" Robbins) .Who clams that he is not guilty.At the end of the case,Andy is found guilty and given two life sentences at Shawshank prison Maine.When he is first there he is very closed off from everyone.And has fights with a prison group called ""The Sisters"".Until he tells a guard how to keep money from a will.While in there,he gets the trust of the guards and the warden and builds a strong friendship with a black marketeer named Red(played fantastically by Morgan""The Dreamcatcher,The Se7ven""Freeman).Things are going well,till an inmate Tommy,tells Andy,that in a prison he was in,he met the man who did the murder Andys in Shawshank for.The warden,who thinks Tommy is to much of a risk for his money business due to Andy doing all work for him),so he kills Tommy.After this,Andy decides its time he gets out of Shawshank.View on the film:The cast. This is one of the rare films,where all the cast just click into there roles.The two leads Robbins and Freeman,who give some of there best work in this film.The way they work and build there friendship in the film,that is sadly rarely seen in any movies.The supporting characters in the film do a really good job at standing out and not feeling like they are just card-board cut outs.The main one in the supporting cast that stand out is James Whitmore as Brooks.who makes a very enjoyable characters,who you feel very sad,to see go out in a very sad way.The Screenply/Direction.Wirter/director Frank""The Green Mile"" Darabont (who made a student-film based on a King short story:The Woman in the Red Room),does a screenplay that easily improves on the short story.While Kings short story spent (i feel) a bit to much time on the exposition in his story,while Darabont makes sure to keep the set-up going at a good pace,and to tighten some of the story lines(Brooks was hardly in the short story,Tommy was not killed).But he makes sure to keep the feel of the story so they do not feel as strange add-ons to the story.The direction the Darabont does is to make sure to see the actors work build in the scenes,while doing a good job at keeping the film going at a pace that does not feel over-long (something that is rare with movies now). Final view on the film:A movie anyone can enjoy,from age 18-80!"
" The best movie ever!
",,"Even though this movie is over 10 years old, the message about friendship and not ever giving up will be relevant forever. The lessons that the main characters teach us in the face of adversity are timeless. This is also one movie that does not get old, and I have watched ""Shawshank"" many times. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were spectacular in their performances. They teach lessons that are extremely memorable and have quotes that you will never forget. The one quote in the film that is a stand-out is, ""Get busy living, or get busy dying"". Who would not feel the impact of that quote? This is one movie you have to have in your library, and I am not one that usually buys DVD's. This is a MUST SEE!!!! Don't miss this one, and also keep a box of tissues nearby."
" best film of all time
",spoiler,The Shawshank Redemption as a film is the most powerful and moving films I have seen and regard it as the best of all time yes there are many grate film out there many that are over looked by many people but as this film has shown box office ratings mean very little in the grand stage time a film that ca be classed as a true classic is one like this thats stands the test of time with grate acting and filming this one move people in ways other films can only hope to do. An it transcends all ages and class with a true hart felt tale of two men over coming adversity in a truly horrible place like the Shawshank prison in this way it moves me to think how would i cope in that place if i could at all stand that kind of life for that long but it has a lighter side to it as Andy get one over the Worden and escapes the cells to freedom
" The Greatest Movie Ever To Be Told On Film
",,"Shawshank Redemption, based on a short story by Stephen King, is about a man named Andy who is sent to jail after being convicted of killing his wife and lover He adapts to jail and is planning something big - all through the film, clues are given as to what he is doing as he takes advantage of certain privileges he has.He makes friends with people in jail, and goes through his daily life. Hope is all he can hold on to, count on, and rely on. Through years he figures a way to end all of it. The story fallows himself and friends as they try to rid themselves of an underlying feeling - a feeling of always being trapped. They hated the walls of the jail. They've grown used to them. And they love them. But not Andy.Everything about this movie is amazing. Screenplay, cinematography,acting, production... its simply one of the best films off all time."

Well i was spellbound and shocked at the ending, and then looked after by the director as they completed the film on the beach in Mexico.A truly wonderful film, worthy of not just the Oscar nominations but the all the Oscars themselves. To be taken on a the most wonderful of cinematic journeys......This is what we all dream of.Frank Darabont, Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins and Stephen King's Finest Hour.Exceptional 10/10"
" It took me while to come around, but this is one of the best!
",spoiler,"I rarely post comments on movies unless I, {A) Really love it, (B) Really hate it. This falls in the 'really love' category. The first time I watched this picture, I thought it was great, but much to dark and emotional, and contained unnecessary violence/sexuality. After viewing it 2 or 3 times, I finally understand why this movie is so highly ranked by IMDb regulars, and I also have come to understand why the scenes of violence and brutality toward Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) were included in this film. I also understand why James Whitmore's character Brooks Hatlen behaved the way he did. It was all the nastiness that happened to people we really like that makes the victory complete at the end. 5 years ago I would have called The Shawshank Redemption an overrated, self-indulging unnecessarily dark picture deserving a rating of 5 or perhaps 6 at best. Now that the move is nearly 12 years old, and now that I've watched it enough to finally ""get it"", I must agree with the masses and score this with a 9+. One of the best movies ever made and certainly the best of the Stephen King adaptations. How could I have been so obtuse?"
" Best Film ever
",,"Nothing in the history of the entertainment industry compares to this films wonderful, inspiring and completely unforgettable ending. The title of the film is the on criticism you could make of this masterpiece. If you talk to any group of people about ""what's the best film ever made"" you're almost guaranteed that someone in the group will mention this film.The script is superb and both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins really do make it a moving story of friendship, dignity, and most importantly hope. It's one of those films where you feel obliged to recommend it to everyone you know. Theirs something so special about this film and you shouldn't be allowed to talk about films if you've missed this gem."
" An Amazing and Emotional Film, one of the very best.
",,"This movie has to be one of the very best films i've seen in my lifetime. I am usually not that fond of drama films but the portrayal of the characters and the amazing script made it a perfect translation from the Stephen King book. Morgan Freeman gives one of his best performances in this movie and actually makes you believe him as a jail smuggler, better than Chris Rock in the Longest Yard ever did. The cinematography is brilliant showing the sheer scale of this old decaying prison. The movie may not have received any Academy Awards (the show was stolen by Forrest Gump that year) but it still remains to be one of the best films around. If your looking for a deeper movie more than you're typical action flick, this will provide what you were looking for. Go out and rent it, heck go and buy it because you'll want to watch it time and time again."
" The best movie ever made
",spoiler,"I think the shawshank redemption is the best film ever made. It is considered as a drama, but in my opinion this fantastic and entertaining movie has no genre. In my country (Argentina) not a lot of people has seen it but i'm trying to change that situation by recommending it to everybody. Despite not having a great success while it was at the theaters, now with the VHS and the DVD, a lot of people is having a chance to enjoy 142 minutes of greatness and get away from their boring lives at least for just a while. I find the twist that the story makes when Andy escapes from shawshank as simply perfect and unexpected. The only thing i consider that is wrong on the film is that when the movie is over you want to see more and you can't see more because the movie ended and ended perfectly, but i think that with a masterpiece like the shawshank redemption not even 10 hours of movie would be enough. Well i've got a lot more things to say but i don't know really how to express myself. So if haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? just put your shoes on a go running to the video and i know you'll enjoy it. I would like to know who is Allen Greene, i'll get very happy if you e mail me back telling me who he is. Simply the best movie ever made."
" Simply the BEST !

Morgan Freeman takes the first place and also Tim Robbins shows a great performance. There are many memorable scenes in the film. This film can change your point of view for the life, it has that power. It teaches not to give up. Thanks to Stephen King (short story Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption) and Frank Darabont (screenplay) and all others who made that fantastic film. I can not call it just a film. It should be the number one on the list and it will be! As it says 'Fear can hold you prisoner hope can set you free'."

" The single greatest masterpiece of all time.
",,"I am new to commenting on movies, so maybe I shouldn't have started with trying to put the Shawshank Redemption into words. The themes of hope, depression, friendship, greed, and triumph connect with the best acting I have ever seen in a movie. The actors are so good, you begin to look at Morgan Freeman in real life as ""Red"" and Tim Robbins as ""Andy"". The humor is ever present, such as conversations held by the inmates. But perhaps the very best thing for an average viewer is the constant surprises. I'm not talking about monsters jumping from trees, I'm talking about how every time the movie starts to seem to get slow BAM! something happens that represents one of the themes. If you have not seen this movie, maybe because the fact that it is a ""prison movie,"" or maybe because it is now eleven years old, you have missed out on a life experience. It is my favorite movie of all time and always will be. The 9.1 rating on IMDb is so well earned and underrated."
" Does this film deserve it's praise?
",,"I know lots has been said about this film since it bombed at the box office then became a hit through video rental. I am probably not going to add anything new. I am a Stephen King fan, and have a policy not to watch the films made from the books as they usually turn out to be quite dodgy. However, I was urged by a friend to give it a go and I was not disappointed. This film is about hope and redemption and the characterisations are faithful to the original story.Tim Robbins is perfect in the lead role, quietly enigmatic, just as I had pictured when reading the book.The movie is quite old fashioned in concept but don't let this deter you. You are taken through the whole spectrum of human emotions and end up feeling better because of watching it. The relationship between the two lead men is charming and kind of restores your faith in human nature.You must watch this movie whether or not you have seen it before, because it makes you feel good.This film will end up being a perennial classic up there with the likes of ""it's a wonderful life"" and ""the wizard of oz"".I can't think of a single criticism."
" The Reason I don't pay attention to the Oscars
",,"This movie is one of the greatest I have ever seen. Morgan Freeman gives an unbelievable performance in this work. The direction of it is exquisite (and gives much to Tim Robbins character, I know he is a good actor, but the direction gives so much more to him).  The soundrack is unparalleled and the story is exquisite (thanks to Stephen King).  I have seen many greats, Citizen Kane, The Godfather, Cuckoo's Nest, The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now....etc. This movie is fantastic, and the fact it didnt' win (or even get nominated) for an Oscar is the reason I don't pay attention to the Oscars anymore. This movie is fantastic, and an artistic triumph. I have no respect for the Academy for ignoring this flick."
" Powerful, Put It Up for #1
",,"'94...the year the greatest movie to exist on this site was created...to bad you movie-goers disagree. Godfather Part I is a classic, but get real you can't defy this movie.  It may get slow at points but it overcomes that with amazing cleverness and a few tricks up the director's sleeve. If you see or have seen this movie you will find or know that this movies brings out many surprises."
" excellent emotional rescue
",,"This movie is excellent in every way you look at it. Even the ways you don't know about it is excellent.  Every time I think about this movie it makes me want to watch it again. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give one heck of a performance. A brilliant masterpiece to show how cruel the system was and how they can take away your freedom with flimsy evidence. (It was back in the 30's, it's probably the best justice system they had).  And how cruel the prison system was back in the day. 2nd all time favorite move. (1st being Platoon)."
" one to watch
",,"One of the best films I've ever seen you just have to see it for yourself and you will know why, However if you're a big Sly or Arnold fan, you may not like it as it doesn't have any exploding cars, plus it has a lot of dialogue and some words with more than two syllables"
" A brilliant movie
",,"I can't believe I waited this long to watch this movie. But I saw it was going to be on tv tonight so I sat down and watched it. It was time well spent. The acting was excellent (especially Tim Robbins), the storyline was interesting...everything was great. As another reviewer mentioned, the time flies by when you're watching it. When the movie finished, I looked at the clock and was amazed that 3 hours had gone by. I'll certainly watch this movie again."
" IMDB #2 quality movie of all time, is truly #1 for many
",,"This movie was far ahead of its time. It had the best picture, soundtrack, brilliant acting, decriptive characters, masterful storyline as in example illustrated the ideal prison life to the bone,  and was first of its kind to come out with a unbelivable(shocking) ending. If you haven't watched this movie yet, you are depriving your eyes from the ""amazing"" it craves. The ending is so beautiful, one can't dare to imagine."
" One of the brightest gems from the Hollywood treasures

Therefore, I am afraid that the tremendous emotion tremble will not let me be objective. However, I really do not care; I'm just writing to share with all of you the greatness of this movie. A movie that brings to screen hope, despair, true friendship, perseverance and human nature like no one before. If you just are reading reviews to see if the film is worthwhile, well don't lose more time and watch it!"
" Wonderful Movie
",,"This is a movie to be watched over and over.  Each time I get a little bit more out of it.  Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins have a great chemistry together.  Many people do not realize that this movie was based on a Stephen King (one of my favorite authors) novel, ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"", especially since it is not of the horror/sci-fi genre. I was really glad to see this one at the top of the list."
" Perfecta
",,"Run Tim Robbins's name in the database, and I don't think you'll find that he's starred in too many movies worth watching.  Generally, most movies he's in have the subtlety of a ball peen hammer across your forehead.  This movie atones for a thousand sins.  Carefully written, deliberately paced, lovingly acted, this film brings you in and leads you to the light on the other side. Nothing is forced, but not a single plot thread is left dangling. Hollywood needs a lot more movies like this one.  See it twice."
" A movie worth seeing again and again.
",,"This movie is one of the few movies that I love to see over and over again. Each time I see it, I learn more and more.  Like figuring out the joke about ""salvation lies within.""  I also learned that the movie is more about Red than it is about Andy.  It is as if Andy was sent there by God to give Red hope and to bring good to what was evil within.  This movie has everything a movie needs.  It makes you laugh, cry, and feel really good, giving you a feeling of hope."
" a really good movie
",,"The first time I saw this movie I loved it. But I loved it more and more every time I saw it again. If you want to have a good and entertaining time watching a movie, buy this movie."
" Outstanding!!!
",,"This movie is flawless in my opinion.  Every situation and character are so intricately woven, there is no wasted celluloid here.  Every aspect of the movie, from acting, directing, and all factors that make up a masterpiece are in top form.  It is truly a testament to the spirit of man and how each one of us handles what life throws at us in our own way.  If you are feeling down, give it a watch and it's hard not to be inspired.  I find more meaning with each viewing.  It's one of the few movies that I've not grown tired of watching again and again.  Once again, in my opinion, it's one of the best!"
" Captivating, breathtaking and compelling...
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is, without a doubt, the greatest film ever made. You simply will never find a better film, ever.The story revolves around a smart, kind hearted vice president of a bank named Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, who is absolutely brilliant in the starring role. Andy is sent to prison after murdering his wife and lover. Claiming he is innocent of the crimes, and was the victim of an unfortunate coincidence, the law does not believe him, and sentences him to life in prison without possibility of parole. Once inside, he immediately befriends a criminal by the name of Red, played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman. Andy then becomes the victim of fear, despair, and the prison itself, which is inhabited by crooked officials and hardened criminals. After a while, Andy finds the hope inside of him to never give up, with the help of his friend Red and others. He starts doing tax returns for the prison guards and the warden, and after a while, the warden, played by Bob Gunton, who makes the viewer loathe the word warden, has Andy doing his tax fraud for him. It's safe to say that Andy is ""friends"" with the officials.I don't want to give it away for those of you who haven't seen this picture, but believe me, you will be breathless. The hope Andy holds inside of him gives all of us a warm feeling inside of us, and tells you to never give up. The cast is perfect in every way, and the film just carries beautifully. You will find yourself praying for Andy through the whole film, through bad times and even good times. It is wonderfully capped off with a surprise twist ending that will leave you shocked, stunned and emotionally breathless.I call this film my all time favorite, because I agreed with the characters, felt for them, hoped for them and in the case of the corrupt characters, loathed them, due to great acting. I was able to actually hate and detest certain characters, because that's how wonderful the acting is. I would actually have cried at this movie, if it weren't for me being so emotionally paralyzed by the cast and story."

" hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things
",,"I tell you my voice sailed higher and farther than anybody in a grey place dares to dream to see my favorite movie still reigning at the number 1 spot on the top 250. Redemption, now let me see, I don't think I know what that means, to tell you the truth that's a politicians word. What do you really want to know, does redemption happen in this film, well yeah, I don't have it stuffed down my pants right now, sorry to say but I'll tell you.  I suggest you just get busy livin or get busy dyin before you find out how salvation lies within. I have to remind myself that some films aren't meant to be caged and kept to yourself, that there's something inside that they can't touch, i'm talking about hope. Those who know Shawshank best talk about it often, but its that much more drab and empty now that its gone out of theaters.  It's not easy peasy japanesey any more, its more like skin burning and half blind from that delousin stuff they throw on you. It looked at first like a stiff would blow it over, but that was my first impression of the film. There's nothing left but all the time in the world to think about why you haven't seen Shawshank yet.  From now on I'll write two comments a day about this film instead of one."
" Excellent film
",,"This is one of my favourite films ever. Why? Well a lot of reasons really. But mostly because of the plot. It contains just about everything needed for a film to really work like art. The actors are superb (note: Freeman - why he didn't receive an Oscar for this one, I'll never understand). The story is great, and written by my all time favourite writer - Stephen King (Misery, Dolores Claiborne, The Shining, Carrie and more), which are all among my absolute top films. Try them out. I promise you all several great movie-moments."
" I'd give this movie 11 if I could
",,"This film is hard, exciting, realistic, beautiful and surprising. The Shawshank Redemption completely absorbs you and constantly throws you back and forth between joy and sadness. It simply blew me away, and if it was possible, I would give it 11 without thinking twice."
" A Very Good Movie
",,"From the outside, the Shawshank State Prison looks like an English country home, with turreted corners and a wide open surrounding lawn.   It's only when you get inside and see the walls and meet the brutal guards that you start to realize that the state government simply wants you out of sight and out of mind.  And that if you die in Shawshank, the only reason that might interest the government or the public is that it will save them money.The two main protagonists are Andy Durfresne (played by Tim Robbins) and Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (played by Morgan Freeman).  Andy is the new prisoner, a banker and investment expert convicted of killing his wife and her lover.  Red is the experienced con, who makes do on the inside by smuggling cigarettes, whiskey, tooth brushes, movie posters, etc. into the prison, and facilitating a market between the prisoners and between the prisoners and the guards.Two other important characters are prison Warden Norton (played by Bob Gunton) and the Captain Hadley (wonderfully played by Clancy Brown). Andy, obviously, isn't your usual prisoner.  For one thing, he doesn't look very tough, certainly not tough enough to have killed anyone. Red bets that Andy will be the first of the new draft of prisoners to ""break"" during their first night locked in cells, by crying.  And ""The Sisters,"" prisoners who delight in raping other prisoners, target Andy from day one.Well, both Red and ""The Sisters"" are wrong. Andy doesn't say a bad word about his confinement or his cell.  And ""The Sisters"" have to beat the Hell out of Andy time after time to get any enjoyment out of him.  (Another feature of prison life which Andy doesn't complain about.)  What Andy does, is try to get on living. He has this hobby of rock carving, for which Red can supply the necessary tools and rocks.  He is also good at doing things like filling out tax forms and giving investment advice. This skill comes to the attention of the Warden and the guards, especially Hadley.  Soon, although not soon enough, Andy is given a trivial job in the prison library and protection from The Sisters in turn for providing investment advice to the guards and, for laundering all the money the Warden is making off the free labor he controls.Andy does other things to.  Over time he manages to turn the dark,  basement library at the prison into a real library where other convicts can simply read or, with ambition, try for their high school credentials.  In other words, Andy, although a convicted murder is good for the people around him, even a bunch of convicts doing hard time.Is this the way prisons really operate? Can one person make the difference? Well, probably not. In fact I suspect Shawshank is shown to be a nicer place to live than any real state prison is, but the level of gross brutality displayed in the movie by both the guards and by some of the prisoners was all I wanted to see and enough to convince me that I wouldn't want to live there. Also, this is a movie about redemption, a rare enough event in ordinary life to motivate some ""suspension of disbelief.""There's the other side of redemption too, which is punishment of the truly guilty.  The Shawshank Redemption supplies both. And has fun doing so. In fact, when I saw most of the movie by accident on TV, I - who never watches TV - found myself yelling at the kids to be quite so I could follow everything that went on.  And then I went out the next day and rented the video both to enjoy watching it again, and to help answer some left over questions, like ""who really did get redemption?""I strongly encourage you to see the movie to find out the answer to that, and several other questions."
" Best Movie Ever
",,"An inspirational and warm-hearted movie that almost put me to tears at the end. This is one of those rare movies that gets better and better the more times you watch it. The great lines in this movie just made it that much better. The friendship that was portrayed by the main characters Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were totally convincing. It's such an involving movie that grabbed me from the start, and the great music didn't hurt either. Don't miss this powerful prison drama that  shows that ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things."""
" Great, uplifting drama, with one flaw...
",,"I'm sorry, I can't buy these guys as criminals, and that ruined the ""suspension of disbelief"" for me. Otherwise, an excellent story."
" ""Get Busy living, or get busy dying.""
",,"Wow. I love this movie. To date I have probably watched it nearly 40 times... I am not obsessive, whenever it is on, I watch it.For most movies, at least the dramatic ones, I measure them based on how they make me feel. This one makes me feel sad when Brooks dies, angry when Tommy dies, and happy when Red finds his friend. This movie makes me feel good. I know that is not very scientific, but it's the truth. Because of the way it plays on me, I can't help but give it a 10. Here's why:First off, the acting. Tim Robbins is SO subtle that he strikes me as a person that tries to bury his innocence, because in reality it does not matter. Few would argue that Morgan Freeman is brilliant, as usual. But here the supporting cast throws in with equally impressive performances.The Score. Outside the music from the records appearing in the movie, the relatively unobstructive score just helps us confirm what our eyes see, the walls of Shawshank. We feel them, through the music, and break through them as Andy does.And last but not least, My compliments on the cinematography. The site is perfect for the movie, and the clever camera angles and lighting invite us into the dreary prison world."
" Time Flies
",,One interesting thing about this movie is how quickly it seems to pass.  The movie could have continued this story for another 2 or 3 hours and I don't think it would have lost my interest.  I think just because normal people like this movie is no reason to lower its rating with the 'movie critics'. The best movie ever???  Definitely.  Everything else pales in comparison.
" A divine movie experience -- and I was watching it on TV!
",,"I won't repeat the ravings by others about this Movie (yes, that's a capitalized M!) I'll just share with you my experience watching it on CNN last month. I'm a graduate student, and midterm week was approaching. I constantly said to myself: Ok, I'll go to the library at the next commercial break ... but without me knowing it my butt was glued to the seat after the first 5 minutes... and by and by I forgot I was watching a film. Finally when it was over I was left tearful and speechless. It was that powerful an experience. I even feel that my life is enriched so much more after watching the film. Those 3 hours are worth every second of it, I can tell you that!"
" If you can say overrated, I can say Shawshank Redemption
",,"In the long and storied history of cinema, there have always been those films, which are undoubtly overrated.  However, none before and none since have been more overrated then The Shawshank Redemption.  While the Shawshank Redemption is not a waste of your viewing times by any means, it is not the pinnacle of film making.  The performances are good, especially Freeman, but I'm not too high on the way the plot works out.  It doesn't really break any new ground, a man is wrongfully convicted of a crime he didn't commit(Wow, that's new!!), and learns to cope with his new circumstances, while befriending the prison veterans.  While the audience learns a valuable lesson about the determination and courage of the human spirit!  I don't know about you all, but when Robbins escapes from prison during a dramatic thunderstorm, there were more then a few tears coming down my face.  When I see something like this rated in the top 10 films of the 1990s let alone of all time, I have to wonder about people's taste in general.  The message of the movie isn't incredibly powerful nor is the plot.  How can anyone consciously say this movie was the best ever?  It boggles my mind, but I have a few theories.  First this movie is recent enough and shown on TNT enough (like 5 times a month), that alot of people have seen it more then once.  Younger people (I'm talking teens and twenties), who haven't seen many Dramas let alone the real ""great"" movies, will say this is the best. If you ask this same demographic what is the best comedy of all time, they are likely to say something like Happy Gilmore (which Caddyshack blows out of the water for best golf comedy).  These are the kinds of people giving Shawshank it's highest praise, these people are sadly my generation."
" This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is
",,"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"".The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want."

" Best movie ever... Trust me
",,"A few days ago, after a long time, I reviewed ""The Shawshank Redemption"", so I decided it was time to write my review. It may seem easy to review this film, defining it: beautiful or wonderful, but the truth is that they would not be quite exhaustive compliments. ""The Shawshank of Redemption"" is ""The Movie""; perfect from every point of view, the highest point that cinema can ever reach; raw, realistic, powerful, exciting! The plot is absolutely engaging and intriguing, keeping the viewer anxious until the end, making him experience unparalleled emotions, as if he were experiencing those of the characters themselves. The setting of the prison is masterly and completely immerses those who are watching the film. Not to mention the soundtrack, simply imposing. The presence of actors like: Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, puts the exclamation mark on this masterpiece allowing it to go down in history. So in conclusion I can not help but define this film as, perhaps, the best ever; and for those who had not yet looked at it ... Well, I think it's time to recover it, because you can't talk about cinema without having ever seen it. Greetings to all and see you at the next review."

" I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing
",,"The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other."
" GOOD BUT NOT GREAT
",,"How the Shawshank Redemption is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time is unfathomable to mean. Infact there are films in the prison genre which I have found to be more effectively made than the Shawshank Redemption.
Is the film bad? No, infact it's quite the contrary. The performances from the two lead characters are undoubtabely compelling, the film very effectively pulls at your heart springs, and allows you to feel sympathy for supposed criminals. The film is also well crafted from a technical standpoint, with good use of camera angles, and pleasantly crafted cinematography.
The film, however, can best be described as unremarkable. Infact, while some may find it difficult to concede, it seems as though the film weaponizes sentimentality to pander to its audience. The film about the brutality of prison, and the corrupt nature of mankind shouldn't have the tone of a cheesy soap opera, and certainly shouldn't be cleanly wrapped together like a christmas present. The inoffensive, and uncontroversial nature of Shawshank redemption is borderline cringe inducing, and perhaps this seems hyperbolized, but here's an analogy that best describes the problem with the film. Imagine if the godfather who beats up talia shires character gets killed and talia shires smiles and begins hugging her brother and talking about how she can start over her life again. That analogy pretty much sums up the operative problem with shawshank redemption. Its a good movie, well acted, technically impressive, well written, full of compelling moments, however it is simply conventional, and far too pandering. Certainly far from being one of the greatest films of all time."

" A very very well told story
",spoiler,"Okay, the movie is 25 years old. Why write a review so long afterwards? Because the film deserves, the director deserves it, the actors deserve it and, more importantly, you deserve it. ""Prison"" films generally impact, showing people deprived of the most basic right, come and go. More shocking if the prisoner seems innocent, and even more so if prison conditions are very severe. Mix all this with great performances, beautiful locations, a soundtrack that is neat and does not steal the scene and you will have an exciting story of overcoming and hope. In such a mistreated garden, it is almost a miracle that one can cultivate hope, but still so it is with Andy Dufresne, unjustly condemned for the murder of his wife and her lover. Sentenced to life imprisonment, Andy will spend the next 20 years dealing with violence, threats, and will maintain his sense of ""usefulness"" by helping to improve the lives of the dents, helping the corrupt director launder money, and dreaming of Morgan Freeman, his friend from prison. With all of this, Andy remains true to himself, dreaming of days of freedom, even when alerted by his friend: that hope can be dangerous in certain situations, leading a man to desperate decisions if it does not come to fruition.ok, o filme tem 25 anos. Porque escrever um review tanto tempo depois? Porque o filme merece, o diretor merece, os atores merecem e, mais importante, você merece. Filmes ""de prisão"" geralmente causam impacto, mostrando pessoas privadas do mais básico direito, ir e vir. Mais impactante se o prisioneiro parecer inocente, e ainda mais se dentro da prisão as condições forem muito severas. Misture tudo isso com ótimas atuações, belíssimas locações, trilha sonora caprichada e que não rouba a cena e você terá uma história emocionante de superação e esperança. Num jardim tão maltratado, é quase um milagre que alguém consiga cultivar esperança, mas ainda assim é o que acontece com Andy Dufresne, injustamente condenado pelo assassinato da esposa e do amante dela. Condenado a prisão perpétua, Andy passará os próximos 20 anos lidando com violência, ameaças, e manterá seu senso de ""utilidade"" ajudando a melhorar a vida dos dententos, ajudando o diretor corrupto a lavar dinheiro, e sonhando com Red (Morgan Freeman), seu amigo de prisão. Com tudo isso, Andy se mantêm fiel a si mesmo, sonhando com dias de liberdade, até mesmo quando alertado por seu amigo: que a esperança pode ser perigosa em certas situações, levando um homem a decisões desesperadas se não se transforma em realidade."
" The Shawshank Redemption
",,"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years."

It will teach you the value of freedom which we enjoy without giving a second thought. And it will leave you with a sense of happiness which you will experience only rarely.

" Where The Demons Are More Metaphoric Than Figurative
",spoiler,"Under the authorship of the horror king Stephen King, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" explores demons, but not the ones that that come at you at stab you with their pitchforks, no these demons are the ones that's hidden in you and finding ways to release them from your soul till eternity. Like his other masterpiece ""Stand By Me"", this is not the traditional horror fest that made King a cultural icon. Instead we have an old-school structured prison drama about two life-sentenced convicts who embark on a quest to break free from the isolation of prison to become free or die trying, whichever comes first.Located in the unforgiving atmosphere of the Shawshank prison cells with prisoners coming in by the dozens, the prison walls is just as much of scary place lie the Overlook Hotel only with chains and creaking walls to accompany every unsettling minute that comes about in this place that makes hell look like a tropical paradise. For more added effect, there's a raven that makes his home there and even has a name, Jake who's under the eyes of aging ex-murderer Brooks (James Whitmore) who works as the prison librarian. A lot of the cliches of prison life pays homage to the old-school prison camps with familiar characters like the Bible-preaching tyrant Warden (Bob Gunton) and a no-nonsense, short-tempered prison guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown).Starting his career directing B-movies (The Fly II) and forgettable TV movies like ""Buried Alive"", this was Frank Darabont's chance to show that he can direct films of a similar calibre like Spielberg or Scorsese by taking a rather old format approach to this prison story to make something refreshingly provocative and authentic at the same time. While observing the hell that is prison life with power-abusive guards, hypocritical Bible-thumping wardens and prison food that comes with a side of maggots, this story could explain things better than King's novella in changing the way we look at things and thank the creator for giving us the freedom we have as we speak.The main emphasis of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is on the progressive friendship involving two prisoners of a large age gap, the former banker tuned convicted wrongfully accused murderer Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and regretful veteran prisoner Ellis "" Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman). The opening scenes take place in 1947 as Dufresne was found guilty of murdering his wife and her lover and while he's trying to prove he is innocent of all convictions, there is evidence his footprints were at the scene and his irresponsible ways come to full effect as his hands were on the weapon. Andy was sentenced to life in jail where he'll like spend his years in Maine's unforgiving threshold of hell itself, The Shawshank prison. With a hobby that includes, reading, chess and rock-carving and his vast knowledge of finance and commerce, Andy is still a loner and therefore 30 year veteran prisoner Red starts to befriend him.Andy is not some incarcerated imbecile his powerful education and know-how has managed to turn his life for the better. When Captain Hadley was lamenting about tax collectors confiscating most of his inheritance money, Mr. Dufresne makes a negotiation of how Hadley can keep his full inheritance under the condition that they all get three free cold beers after working in the sun all day tarring the foundations on the roof.His knowledge in finance and investments soon begin to change the landscapes of prison life for not only his prison inmates, but for those those hard-nosed people who run the prison system. For the guards he's now filing their taxes while for his inmates he's earned enough money to transform a spider-web infested rundown library into a bigger facility for the inmates to take advantage of. And sure this was done in six years, Andy has become a symbol of perseverance.It's strange that we can watch a movie and be sympathetic to a convicted murderer but his message of determination makes us really care for him and hope that he'll be released anytime soon. That feeling of determination is passed down to friend Red who fears he'll suffer the same fate that Brooks did after being 50 years imprisoned only to lead him to suicide because he felt like a nobody in the real world with no friends or family.In return, Red's offering is the power of clemency. Where Andy fully explains what really happened the night when his wife was killed. He confesses that he does take some responsibility for his wife's death and his asking for forgiveness is that turning point to this very well acted and directed movie.Though sadly snubbed by the Oscars, Tim Robbins' Andy Dufresne evolves from a convicted killer ex-banker to a warm highly-respectable friend. Morgan Freeman gives a warm performance as a veteran prisoner who finds the power of optimism and his narration comes across as purposeful than self-serving like other films he's narrated.In the end, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" will likely fill your heads into thanking those around you that you have more freedom than you think in the outside world that should never be taken for granted. It also gives us the feeling that serving time is not the end of the line and no matter where you are if you serve your time wisely you might get rewarded in the long run and that we as humans hold the keys to our own prisons."

" Something With Stephen King Prison Movies Just Works
",,"There is just some thing with Stephen King and prison movies like The Green Mile just works. It is quite disappointing that the best Stephen King movies are the ones like Stand By Me, this, and The Green Mile, including the 2017 IT which did not disappoint. This is on my Top movies list, it's Morgan Freeman, it screams the book, but better. Frank Darabont is a great director, and this a freaking great movie. So great it makes movies like Pet Sematary look like a crappy 80's movie."
" Hope Versus Fear.
",,"My Rating : 9.5/10'Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.'This is the thoughtful and paradoxical tagline of the prison-drama saga entitled 'The Shawshank Redemption'.With a runtime of 2 hours and 22 minutes, The Shawshank Redemption is truly director Frank Darabont's baby. But does it serve to be a dream come true for the viewers? The answer is a resounding yes, according to me.Though it failed miserably at the time of release it is now heralded as one of the greatest of the greatest that the medium of cinema has ever seen. It is #1 on the imdb Top 250.It is an impressive, engrossing filmmaking masterpiece adapted from the horror prodigy Stephen King's 1982 novella 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption'. With Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman as its main characters, the movie offers marvelous acting although Robbins' Andy Dufresne scores low with respect to his overall energy I feel. It almost seems artificial, bland and repetitive. Serving a life sentence for murder, Red (Morgan Freeman) is a blend of cynicism and sincerity - a man with a good soul who has done a vile deed in his past. His friendship with Andy is the film's main highlight.The inspirational, life-affirming and uplifting, old-fashioned style (the music and some of the cinematography) Hollywood production (Castle Rock Entertainment) is a combination of a prison-drama film as well as excellent character study. The film takes the-innocent-man-in-prison theme and gives it a new angle. Instead of focusing on crusades for freedom, the film ventures down a less-travelled road, concentrating on the personal cost of adapting to prison life and how some convicts, once they conform, lose the ability to survive beyond the barbed wire and iron bars of the prison cell. As one of the character puts it : ""These walls are funny. First, you hate them, then you get used to them, then you start to depend on them."" This is the case with Brooks (excellently portrayed by James Whitmore) who is completely institutionalized and the scenes with him attempting to cope with life outside of prison represents one of the film's most moving and effective sequences.The chiaroscuro of the entire film is incredible and of the scenes which leaves an impression on one's mind is one when Andy, after escaping from the prison, expresses his joy and freedom by looking up at the dark sky and his upward-facing hands welcoming raindrops to fall over his body.Darabont's film is a patiently-told, allegorical tale (unfolding like a long-played, sometimes painstakingly long chess game) of friendship, hope, survival, emancipation and ultimate redemption and salvation by the time of the film's finale.However, on the downside, following a solid two hours of thought-provoking drama, the film deflates like a punctured balloon during its overlong denouement. The all-too-predictable final twenty two minutes move a little slowly and my heart goes out to Darabont who displays a distressing need to wrap up everything into a tidy little package.All in all, the film is undoubtedly great and only time will tell if it holds up another 25 or so years down the line. It's already been 24 years but I hope the future generations enjoy it just as much and not be put off by the pace and style of the narrative. 9/10."
" I LIKE IT
",,"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them."
" A Moving, Cinematic Classic!
",,"The first thing that really struck me after watching Frank Darabondt's THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION was how much it resembled parts of the plot, but most of all the feel of John Steinbeck's OF MICE AND MEN. What is THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION really about? Yes, it's about a hellish prison, it's about how corruptible some human beings can be, it's about the good and the bad and the ugly of humanity, it's about depression, it's about yearning for belonging, it's about hope but most of all (like of MICE AND MEN), it's about one, truly glorious friendship. I do (of course) refer to the brilliant and heartwarming bromance shared by one Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and one Red (Morgan Freeman). It's their tale of friendship and sacrifice that takes place in the living hell that is Shawshank prison and their brutally honest story is brought, magnificently to the screen by Frank Darabondt. Every, single, vital element of this film is done to cinematic perfection: the writing, the directing, the cinematography, the scoring and of course the acting. All these elements are executed perfectly and the story is told with poignant, brutal, raw honesty. It makes you immediately stop and think about the days when ""prison"" meant prison and how if you went down, you were as a good as dead. We see this by the horrendous cruelty that Andy experiences at the hands of the brutal Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), the vile, rapist inmate Bogs (Mark Rolston) and finally, by the black hearted and truly evil, Warden Norton (Bob Gunton). We see men, in short, treated and brutalised like animals. We see men suffering from utter hopelessness and depression but still trying to build a life around their grieving situation. However, we also see the lighter side of things and this is where the film is most moving; we see people making a working environment in prison and how they carry hope with them (some, more than others) and try their best to live a productive life in a harsh environment. Darabondt brings this to life epically; he directs perfectly, getting the uttermost from his cast and pulling everything together marvellously, he writes powerfully, breathing real life to each character and clearly marking out the heroes and villains. He makes you feel about each and every character and you end up truly caring about their hopes and dreams for the future. Like I said, this film (I believe) owes much to OF MICE AND MEN and as we focus on Andy and Red, (I think) you can appreciate how much they both resemble George and Lenny. They care and love each other almost like brothers and share a wonderful dream of someday escaping their current hell and living the dream. Sound familiar? He is a truly talented writer and with the script, as well as being able to make you shocked, horrified and sad, he can also make you laugh, make you happy and make you charmed as you behold the lighter side to the life in Shawshank. In short, Darabondt pulls together a truly marvellous piece of cinema that captures the inner turmoil and quest for hope and peace of the human spirit.However, Darabondt's brilliant directing is not the only great thing about the film. The cinematography in this film was simply breathtaking, courtesy of the great Roger Deakins. I always love the poetic way in which Deakins tells a story with the camera. It feels poetic and mystical: the way in which the camera flies over the prison inmates, Andy in the sewage pipe, Andy in the rain and the beaches around the Atlantic Ocean. Wether it's BLADE RUNNER 2049 or SICARIO, Deakins captures the spirit of every story he films perfectly and is a true artist with the film camera. Another great thing about the film is the score, courtesy of Thomas Newman. It builds throughout the film with a combination of soft piano and strings. His composing is filled with such poignant emotion and poetry and it really struck me how much this score resembled his work for Sam Mendes's 2002 thriller ROAD TO PERDITION. In both films, the score lifts each scene and makes the film powerful and poignant. 
 
Finally, the true brilliance of the film (or, when you think about it, any film) lies with its cast. The cast for this film was truly magnificent with some of the 20th centuries finest actors giving it their 110%! The main standouts are (without a doubt) Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Robbins is powerfully poignant and moving as the movie's wronged hero. He steals every scene as his face paints pictures of sorrow, regret, depression and gentle optimism. He makes you feel so much for the character and you almost feel as if you're going through life in Shawshank with him. Put it this way: his performance in this film couldn't be further from his performance in something like THE HUDSUCKER PROXY! Morgan Freeman was also frankly masterful in this film as he shows what a truly talented actor he is. His portrayal of a worn-out but kindhearted individual is heartwarming and sincere but also his methodical, poetic, poignant, and now famous narration is truly marvellous. The story is really lifted with his virtual fairytale narration and to quote from TED 2 (as said to Freeman) ""I could go to sleep on a bed made of your voice!"" Everyone else in the film is marvellous so its hard to pick who else deserves a mention, but I think you definitely have to mention Shawshank's vile Warden Norton, played by Bob Gunton. At first, he pretends to be a firm but fair teacher with good, pure values, but as the film progresses, you see that his heart is as black as the some of the prisoners he keeps. He's ruthlessly ambitious and hides behind the facade of protector. He's truly as ""boo and hiss"" sort of villain and Gunton plays the character perfectly! All these wonderful factors carried the film along to its shocking but wonderful conclusion. I won't spoil if you haven't seen it but I will say that the film truly ends, perfectly! THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION captures what many films have tried to and failed: the human nature! I've seen very few films that capture the human nature in such a raw and uncompromising way. It's a truly masterful piece of cinema and probably the best 'prison movie' since COOL HAND LUKE..."
" Best movie ever
",,"Simply the best movie I've ever seen in my life. The performances are excellent and clean, engaging story. It's one of those movies that leaves you thinking about life for months. Awesome! It deserves the first place."
" Andy n Red
",spoiler,"Andy is an innocent man who gets sent to prison for murdering his wife. He endures many hardships such as listening to opera records, and having to do the taxes of prison guards for free. He falls in love with an old black guy named Red, who likes to narrate things. Red is a very wise man who says things like ""Get busy living, or get busy dying"" and ""Show me the money"". 
Andy gets tired of being in prison and steals the warden's shoes and escapes. The warden blows his brains out because Andy stole his shoes. Red misses Andy and leaves prison to go live with him on the beach.
This is definitely the greatest movie ever made. Except for ""Overboard"". The one with Goldie Hawn and Kurt Douglas. Not the new one."
" The Shawshank Redemption regard it naively as just another prison movie
",,"The Shawshank Redemption was never a summer blockbuster or a critically acclaimed behemoth of a film but it is widely regarded now as one of the best American films of all-time. Many people have cited this movie as having changed their lives for the better when they were going through difficult times in their personal or professional lives. Above all else, The Shawshank Redemption is a story about one man's ability to remain hopeful during the most difficult and harsh circumstances. As Red states at the end of the film, ""Get busy livin' or get busy dyin.' That's goddamn right."""

And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today."

" A timeless masterpiece. A heart wrenching drama. An epic tale of true friendship.
",,"I had never heard about this film before. It was just one day while I was searching my local DVD store this year that I found a brand new, special two-disc collector's edition. The title attracted me, and as I browsed the internet before buying the disc, I was blown away by the response the film had got. I instantly brought the DVD, but sadly couldn't watch it for long. Today, I finally decided to watch it, and by the time it ended, all I had was the happiness of watching a heart wrenching drama and a smile on my face.THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is truly a timeless masterpiece. It's a very old film, but no matter how many times you watch it, you're gonna love it. This is a very emotional and inspiring prison drama which is worth watching by one and all despite of its content rating. Not only has the film been written and directed masterfully by Frank Darabont, it also has stellar performances coming from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Believe me, the two make the best buddies I've ever seen in a film till date.SR is a pure drama with some crime element thrown in. But it doesn't fail to impress and entertain you, and even surprises you before the time it ends. It makes sure that you get inspired and moved by the message it delivers with perfection. Another great thing: it has no romance to hinder the story. It's a heartwarming, effective and unforgettable character drama which makes you unable to get from your seat till the very end.Some think it's overrated, but honestly, it isn't. After all, this is a film which anyone who likes movies, especially dramas, can very easily appreciate. I just liked to see Tim and Morgan in a frame, because whenever they come together, there's something wonderful going to happen. The dialogues are brilliantly written: there are a lot of lines bound to be remembered forever.Technically too, the film shines. A film set within a prison could've been devoid of any visual excellence but the cinematographer has totally nailed it, providing us with the clear vision of what the director wanted us to see. Through this entire duration of 140 minutes, I felt a different range of emotions from sadness to happiness to even anger at times. It's that powerful.Saying anything more would sound like an understatement. Many others have already praised the film in their respective reviews, and I totally appreciate that. It's sad that such a great film wasn't a commercial success. But its real success lies in being the most memorable drama of all time. I really feel happy and lucky for having brought the DVD."

I am not one for re-watching movies or rereading books, but this movie is one of the few exceptions. I can recite more than half of the lines and it makes my day anytime that I see it is on (shout out to AMC for literally running marathons of it). It has a fulfilling plot that develops well and a great cast all around. To this day, it amazes me that it was not a box office hit.It's a movie that will make you laugh and cry, a movie that will break your heart one moment and the next you'll be pumping your fist in satisfaction. This is certainly a 10/10 in my books. ""Get busy living, or get busy dying""."

It has a touching, powerful, and heartfelt story. It has complex characters and a detailed storyline. Even after 20+ years, Shawshank holds its own as a masterclass film.The acting is great. Tim Robbins gives the best performance of his career. Morgan Freeman also delivers a wonderous performance. All of the supporting characters add so much to the story.The pacing is perfect and the runtime is good at just under two and a half hours.All in all, this film truly does belong at the top of IMDb's Top 250.

" hope never dies
",,"The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."
" The Shawshank Redemption
",,"I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing."

Amazing acting by these two.wonderful story and just amazing movie.words are not enough to tell I great this movie is.its just flows with you."
" Hen I sa
",spoiler,"Hen I say ""The Movie"", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those ""Budget Theaters"" over the summer of 1995. None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, we saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... ""HOPE"". This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time. I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history! How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films. However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'"
" One for the Ages (Mild Spoilers)
",spoiler,"The Shawshank Redemption is directed and written by Frand Darabont. Based off the Stephen King novel, the movie stars Tim Robbins (Andy Dufresne) and Morgan Freeman (Red). The main character, Andy, a former banker is sentenced to two life sentences for apparently killing his wife and the man she was cheating on him with. When Andy first arrives at Shawshank, he suffers the typical hardships of prison but making new friendships with the other prisoners makes it more bearable for him. However, when the Warden takes notice of his banker talents, he takes him under his wing in the form of doing all the officers' taxes.What needs to be said about The Shawshank Redemption has already been said. Rather than talking about what the movie has, it is better to talk about the legacy that the movie has left behind. A well-developed story is what separates a good movie from an all-time great movie and Shawshank Redemption is all about the story. The film follows the classical paradigm which is composed of a rising action, a climax and a resolution. In these types of stories, we usually see a ""shaping hand"" in the hand in the story line. The storyteller is there to ""edit out"" the boring gaps and keeps a low profile yet still keeps the action on track, moving towards the resolution of the story's conflict. In this film, the obvious story teller is Morgan Freeman's character (""Red""). Even though Andy is the main character in the story, being able to be in Red's head gives the director suspense to play with. If the story was told in the perspective of Andy, the audience would not have nearly had the same amount of payoff the climax has in the movie. Red basically acts as the thoughts that audience is thinking which is not a bad thing. In fact, this outstanding performance by Freeman launched him into the go-to narrator that we all know and love today. An important component of a good story are dynamic characters and Shawshank has arguably some of the best characters in any film. First, Andy's development over the film is impactful. In the beginning of the film, Andy is portrayed as someone who has been wrongly convicted and is a genuine ""good"" person inside and out. This is seen in the beginning of not fighting back when he is confronted constantly by the sisters to not talking back or picking fights with the guards or the other prison mates. He stayed quiet and reserved to himself. However, he soon realizes that doing good, is not the same as being morally good and that you can do bad things with a good intention. An example of this is when he gets the record from the state government. He knows he will get in a whole lot of trouble if he plays the record over the loudspeaker but he did it anyway because he believed that it was the right thing to fill the ears of the prisoners, yearning for music. He got in trouble and spent time in the dark cell but he knew that he did good. However, the best character development is seen in Red's interactions with the rehabilitation board in the parole room. Through each of the parole scenes following each act, you can see the progression of his character getting more tired as the movie goes on and as he gets older. In his final parole room scene, he explains that he never knew what ""Rehabilitation"" means and Morgan Freeman delivers one of his famous dialogues where he says, ""Rehabilitation is just a made up word so people like you can dress up in a suit and tie and have a job.""Although director Frand Darabont utilizes great cinematography, sound, editing and has created some of the most famous shots in movie history, it is the ""bar setting"" story of The Shawshank Redemption that sets it apart from all other films in any ""Top 10"" list and gives it the highest rating on IMBD."
" The Best, ever and forever.
",,"For me, ""the best ever"".
Everything is simply amazing. 
Its relevant and appropriate even after 24 years of its release. You just love it. Go for it. Shawshank is waiting for you :)."
" Best movie ever
",,This is one of the best moves ever. Great story and great actors.
" Must Watch if you have given up hope!
",,"I have always heard what a great movie it was but never got myself to watch it since I didn't want to watch a prison movie. However, I am so glad I watched it! I was sort-of suicidal when I watched it; and it gave me hope and made my heart warm even when I was at my lowest!"
" An Amazing film!
",,"I watched this movie just to pass out some good time... and you know what.. i had sore and wet eyes at the end.. i don't know why but the movie's end, couldn't stop myself..andy's portrayal by tim robbins and red's by morgan freeman was absolutely great..i like and love andy's philosophy that ""hope is a good thing.."" .. and i have tried to inculcate that in me.. i just loved the movie.. i was like.. whats this, its ended so fast.. i didn't it want to end.. i am not a con and neither i wanna be.. but it has shown even the guys out there in the prisons also can be innocent.. and to prove their innocence they can go to any lengths.. i mean that they also have got something in them.. their hearts.. the spirit shown by andy was absolutely great.. it shows that when you want to do something, do it with full heart.. i have just finished it..but i'm sure i m gonna watch this very often, and am not going to forget it for a long length of time.."
" Best Movie Ever?
",,"I'm not going to go in detail about the brilliance of the Shawshank Redemption; it would be too much and the most haas already been said.
For me,it is a tie between this and 1960's Psycho as the best movie ever.
It does what nearly no movie does. It climbs through your skin, into your soul.
If you have watched it already, go watch it again and if you have not, go buy yourself a blu ray and watch it. There's nothing more to say about it. If there was ever a 11/10 movie, the Shawshank Redemption would be this movie."
" nothing special
",,"Saw this movie after seeing imdb top rated movies and doubted what s wrong with those people who consider this movie as a masterpiece.
the movie is so plain i understand it is a old movie and a feel good one but keeping it number 1 above pulp fiction or prestige movies does nt make any sense"
" 10 out of 10 - SuperB
",,"I shall be short with no spoilers about the movie.This is a superb picture. Everything is right, spot on right. Beautiful acting, good camera work and a soundtrack that really helps the movie to that extra level. It is a slow, but not too slow, unraveling story with some nice twists and turns in it, all with a good ending.Do not expect much comedy and quick action, but a good story.My recommendation: 10 out of 10 points"
" excellent engaging drama
",,"This is one of those dramas that will keep on tied till the end. It showed the beauty of a griping screenplay. Some films will give a spark from the first glance itself. This is one movie that takes you deeper the more you watch it. a very thin story line with superb acting. But if you just want to watch a good movie with social message and how to not lose hope, then go for it"
" Best Movie about LIfe lessons
",,"This movie about time, patience and loyalty of two persons, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends. At first I did not believe that this movie is very good but when I saw it I was without words. Morgan freeman and Tim Robbins did a great job by moving the story smoothly. One of the best movies."
" the best movie
",,"is the best movie ever made i love it This movie made me laugh and it made me cry, This is probably my 2nd or 3rd favorite movie ranked in my top 5 list. The movie is based in a prison, where violence, sexual references and profanity are part of the daily life. The story line is excellent with great performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman especially. I have watched this movie over 20 times and still enjoy it every time I see it just as much as the first time."
" Awesome Classic
",spoiler,"This movie will be one of my favorite's of all time, it's heartwarming, sad, funny at times and won't let you down. justice is served! Morgan Freeman plays the supporting character for Tim Robbins and just made the movie. He creates so much emotion to this film as the narrator and supporting character to the storyline it just leaves you in total awe of his talent."
" One of the best movies I've ever seend.
",,"This is an masterpiece. A very intense and thrilling movie which aged well.After I bought it in the DVD-Palace and watched from my couch, I recommended it to many people living in my street.It was fabulous!"
" Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things
",,"Years ago I was browsing IMDb and looked at this film called Shawshank Redemption as the highest ranked film. I had to watch it. Everyone I asked around praised the film so I decided to finally sit down and watch. Every single aspect of this film shines, but here are some highlights.Andy's character arc is amazing. He is truly a troubled man, hanging on a single shred of hope to get by a horrible life in prison. Red is a man destined to be in prison, befriending Andy and haunting us in Morgan Freemans impeccable narration. Shawshank Prison is a haunting place, the film just absorbs us into it. We feel it, it feels terrible, eternal even. All this is joined by Thomas Newman's fantastic score (my favorite of his) and one of the most memorable main themes ever made. I had to re-watch this film to fully appreciate every detail. This film wastes no scene, no character. Everything works. And best of all, it's one of the most fulfilling and hopeful films you can watch. It has truly become my favorite film. It came to me in a time when I had lost a lot of hope, so you can consider this to be a personal film as well. Haven't seen it, yet? What are you waiting for??"

In Shawshank, after a difficult start, he becomes his fellow prisoners. One of them is Red, the narrator of the story, who is charmed by the huge cleverness of Andy.

From the superb script, excellent pacing of scenes and stupendous directing and cinematography as well as acting from all of those involved. Don't call yourself a critic or a movie buff if haven't seen this..."
" If you a movie lover, Don't miss a second to see this movie.
",spoiler,"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most uplifting, its have been 23 years but it's still one of the best classic movie ever i saw, morally satisfying films of the '90s. Not because it's religious — God never visits Shawshank — but because this is a story of finding hope in an unshakable friendship between two human beings. i almost saw it 20 times. it's give you a perfect taste of this movie. Trust me you can feel it."
" Nice movie
",,It is really a nice movie I have seen. In beginning it seems some boring but after one hour it change the atmosphere. It is well planned and seen are thriller. I never seen such a beautiful movie. The role which actor has played is memorable and very energetic. I recommend to see it all the movie likers. Must watch movie.
" awesome script
",,"i remember watching this years ago, i loved the setting of the scenes and to me it was pretty good acting. and if anyone is to go see a good movie, i highly recommend this one, with some people it may not be their cup of tea, but, if you want a good kickback with some popcorn and prop your feet up, and take the phone off the hook, and DO NOT ANSWER THE DOOR, DESPITE THE NEIGHBORS WANTING A OCCASIONAL CUP OF SUGAR, than yes, this is good movie to sit back and enjoy."
" the best
",,"There are standard ways to stage a prison film and standard ways to tell a story by Stephen King. But ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" based on a King novella and set in the correctional institution of the title, succeeds in avoiding the familiar.Without a single riot scene or horrific effect, it tells a slow, gentle story of camaraderie and growth, with an ending that abruptly finds poetic justice in what has come before. The writer and director, Frank Darabont, tells this tale with a surprising degree of loving care."
" Very nice!
",spoiler,"Excellent movie, I have watched it twice no thrice :) very thrilling :). The characters fulfilled their roles very good. The graphics was astonishing in my eyes. If you want to enjoy these movie watch this in HD format. It was very memorable to watch such kind of movie. The shawshank redemption is included in my top ten favorite to watch. I will give it an excellent score."
" The best movie I have seen
",,"This movie is about the prisoners. The main character is caught in the false charge. At first, he claims his innocence, but he cannot prove it. In prison, he has his own world. Also, he is so clever. He plans something and it appears 20 years later. When the ordinary people are caught in the false charge, they may give up their life, but he never gives up. He carves out his life. I think he tells me the importance of living and having the hope. There are not so many flashy exciting scene, but there is some moving scene in an important position. They give more impression to audience. There are a lot of prison film, but I like this movie the best. I think the movie should be like this."
" Love
",,This movie is a classic and will watch for years to come !! I highly recommend it. All the actors are great and the scenes will keep you on your feet !! I have already watched it 20 times and purchased a copy that will forever live in my video library .......If you love drama this is the movie to watch
" Hands down the best movie I have ever seen
",,The first time I watched this movie I was immersed in a prison world where survival is on the daily schedule and hope means everything. I was literally breathless for 2 hours. I just cannot believe how this movie was so undervalued when initially released. This is hands down the best movie I have ever seen. This is one movie where the ending does not really matter. It is the journey that will keep you on the edge of your seat and you will wish it never ends.
" about power of friendship
",,"One of my all time favorites.It is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."
" the shawshank redemption (1994)
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is easily my favorite movie of all time. It has every single element that should be looked for in a film. A brilliant script (with the best dialogue ever written), a perfect cast (not one bad performance), and not to mention an original, complex and ultimately uplifting story.Based on the Stephen King novel, Shawshank Redemption is a delight from first scene to last. The opening is a brilliantly done sequence with Andy's (Tim Robbins) trial intercut with his actions on the night of his crime. This leads to him being taken to Shawshank with one of the best shots ever captured on film, with the camera sweeping from behind the prison bus in the air and diving into the middle of the prison yard. There Andy meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and others, and a gradual friendship begins to develop.This movie has that certain indefinable screen magic, every line of dialogue spoken has real conviction and meaning, and the performances in this movie are nothing short of magnificent. Tim Robbins delivers his best screen performance ever, as the quietly spoken Andy. Here is a character like no other, so vivid, so real, that you can't help but like him. Morgan Freeman also delivers his best work ever as Red, Andy's friend. Freeman, while playing a different character from Robbins, is also able to give off a quiet dignity for his character. The supporting cast is perfect. From Bob Gunton, chillingly evil, but never over the top as to become cartoonish, as the Warden. Clancy Brown, as the prison Guard Hadley is brilliant, as is Veteran James Whitmore, as Brooks, who while given relatively small screen time is brilliant as the lifer con who's sad journey the film details.There is not a dull moment or poor line of dialogue in this film. Credit first time director Frank Darabont for this remarkable piece of work. He is a director of the future. I still can't believe this was his first movie!, he will find it hard to top this masterful film. Special mention must be made of the music score by Thomas Newman, who has composed a simple, but perfect score for this film. His scoring of the scene with Andy and Red sitting up against the wall discussing their plans for release is nothing short of brilliant, as is the rest of his score.I encourage everyone who has not seen this to grab it now, as it is surely not only the best movie of the 90's but the best movie of all time.***** out of *****"
" the best movie ever
",,"the movie is life changer Out of any film that has ever been made, this is my far the best one. It's just so special and moving. Such a deep and touching message about life and the institutionalization aspects of prison life. It really touches the inner hopefulness in all of us, or at least everyone who has seen this movie. If you've never seen it, watch it,"
" The best jailhouse movie of all time!

" Worthy of the number one spot.
",spoiler,One of the best movies out there. It is definitely worthy of its number one spot for so many years. I am never bored of re watching it. The cast was excellent and the story unfolds in smooth transition. Amazing narration by an amazing actor and one of my personal favorites Mr. Morgan Freeman. Love the music and the build up to the escape is one of the most amazing escapes story wise.
" Discovered Treasure, Must See!
",,"This gem of a movie The Shawshank Redemption, ironically, was snubbed during its time (1994)---both critically and commercially. In recent years, however, there's a growing legion of cineastes singling out this film as the best, if not, one of the best of all time.This movie is the perfect example of a masterpiece way ahead of its time. Take it as Beethoven's Symphony #5 of cinema. Years go by and the echo of its message gets louder and becomes even more relevant. It's about how we are defined by the establishment's greed and corruption.It's about how we have forgotten our humanity.It's about why our possessions, especially money, continue to deny us of the ever-elusive happiness we all yearn for.It's about our capability to love our fellowmen under any circumstances.Most importantly, it's about life as a matter of choice and how we can outdo the fear that imprisons us in misery. If only we tap our power from within. As its main message suggests, ""Fear can hold us prisoner. Hope can set us free.""The Shawshank Redemption is a must for those undergoing severe depression. It keeps us glued to our seats while all of its elements seem to magnify the message of hope, love AND yes...redemption.With a budget of $25 million, it earned only $58 million. It had 7 Oscar nominations but won nothing. NADA. It is underrated and over qualified.However, it has been #1 on IMDb's user-generated Top 250 since 2008, when it surpassed The Godfather. In my opinion, this is the best movie of all time. Morgan Freeman must be honoured with the best performance of all time.My criteria: unlike The Godfather, The Shawshank Redemption does not only grip the viewer's heart. It zaps the audience to boldly declare: LIFE IS AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL!Don't ever blame me if you fail to see this movie after this post. I warned you."
" MasterPiece

" Great
",,This was one of the greatest movies i have ever seen. Great story. Great character development. It is a story of hope for the ages. I thought it has some elements of reality in all of our lives. Red accepts he is stuck in prison. Tim Robbins character is amazing and is the focal point of the story. He exemplifies many emotions throughout the film.
" A beautiful friendship story
",,"If intention is what counts, A Dream of Freedom is a great film, especially when it focuses on showing the strong friendship of the protagonists. One of the most beautiful friends ever portrayed in the movies. A movie that is very exciting, With great interpretations of great actors"
" Good movie
",spoiler,"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope."
" Great Movie
",,"Great movie makes you feel like you're in the prison with them fighting alongside the convicts in their struggle to survive. The characters are varied and very believable, makes you want to root for some and hate others. The plot is engaging and suspenseful and keeps you guessing to the end what the different characters outcomes will be."
" Shawshank Redemption
",,"I believe that it is an excellent film.The film begins with the conviction of Andy Defresne (Tim Robbins) a banker who in 1946; was ordered to serve two life sentences, back to back, at the Shawshank prison in the State of Maine, for the murder of his wife and her lover. The film portrays how Andy Defresne, uses his banking knowledge to gain ""freedom"" from predatory inmates and the officers in charge of the prison. In the passage of time, he becomes hopeful and influential within the prison. This made him gain the respect of his co-inmates, especially longtime convict ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman) who became his closest ally. Andy eventually, achieves freedom by escaping."
" Movie to be watched
",,"This is a movie that stands the test of time and still resonates with viewers. Call this the Stand by Me of prison stories. Stephen King, who penned Stand by Me, also wrote the short story on which The Shawshank Redemption is based. Here we have all the things that made Stand by Me such a satisfying experience: lovable characters, writer flourishes, one- dimensional evil antagonists, enduring friendships, poetic justice, and a happy ending. This one is far darker and far more violent than Stand by Me and so ought to be reserved only for older teens. The story is slow to develop, and younger kids and children sensitive to the suffering of others may find this world a difficult one to sit with for the film's duration."
" best film ever
",,"It is one of my favorite, the greatest in the world. It shows a man's braveness and right. It reminds us the glory of being a human nature. people are sensitive animal who are always controlled by emotion. Facing the terrible environment, its our nature to fight with it. But when it comes to some extent, we will be despair. But Andy always keep his mind wide open and finally reach his goal."
" On of the Best Movies
",,"This is by far and away one of the best Hollywood films made in a generation. The drama was compelling, the acting was admirable and complimented the story to perfection. The writing was exquisite and placed a balance on leading dialogue and narration. This is a great example of what film making is all about. It doesn't rely heavily on ""movie magic,"" but instead uses camera movement, framing and acting as equal tools in delivering an amazing story to audiences."
" Great Story
",,"This story really earns its right to be a classic. It shows us a society in which we don't see in out everyday lives, some may never see it, and allows us to empathize with people who more or less made poor choices in their past lives. We see what it's like to be in a corrupted society and how that society works based on how you act and we also see what it's like for people to drop in or drop out of a society with nothing but the clothes they came with."

" good reviews of best movie of all time
",spoiler,"The Shawshank Redemption begins with young Andy Dufresne, a young vice-president of a Portland, Maine bank, wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and who is sent to Shawshank Prison to live out the rest of his life. There, he learns how adapt to life in prison and learns lessons about life through fellow prison inmates who become his friends. Nineteen years later, Andy finally leaves the confines of Shawshank, on his very own terms.Andy is intelligent and although rather naÃ¯V in the beginning, he is able to adapt to life within prison by learning from Red who takes a liking to Andy's quiet nature. He is resourceful, as shown when it is revealed at the end of the film that he has planned his escape and life after that flawlessly with only resources made available to him in prison. Andy keeps his hope of freedom alive throughout the years with strength and determination. With integrity, Andy is able to make sure that he does not succumb to anything which may become his downfall.Red, who's real name is Ellis Boyd Reading, is the man who ""I'm the guy whocan get it for you,"" he narrates. The long years in Shawshank has Red 'institutionalised', and he can no longer imagine life on the outside, nor does he expect it. Red is better at perception, as he can see in Andy what others cannot, and befriends the younger man.Warden Samuel Norton is both God-fearing and greedy. He quotes many passages from the Bible throughout the story, but has no qualms in ordering murder to protect his ill-gotten money. He is selfish and destroys any chance for Andy's re-trial by getting rid of Tommy. The fact that he shoots himself after the police come to arrest him shows that Samuel Norton is a weak man who cannot bear the burden of his crimes make-shift desk and provides financial advice services for guards and the warden. Andy is also determined, and the others are aware of his nature.Andy's Blind Self incorporates his quiet nature which tend to be misinterpreted as arrogance by is fellow prison inmates. The judge at his trial for the murder of his wife and her lover in the beginning of the film asserts that Andy seems to be ""a particularly icy and remorseless man"". It would seem like Andy's mannerisms have worked against him in that situation. If he had been aware of the way others perceived him, he may have been able to prevent himself from sending out the wrong message.Andy's strength and determination play important roles in his Hidden Self. When Andy first steps foot into Shawshank, Red makes a bet that Andy would be the first one to cry. ""Lookedlike a stiff breeze could blow him over. That was my first impression of the man,"" Red says. But Andy proves Red wrong. He is stronger than anyone thinks. Red gets Andy the rock hammer which Andy says is for his rock collection hobby, and when the tool arrives, Red dismisses the thought that Andy would use it to escape prison. A series of posters covers the tunnel Andy is working on in the wall, and his daily walks outside is used to dispose of the rubble from his digging. Although his determination later morphs into a trait of Andy's Known Self, his resourcefulness is hidden by the facade of a straight and sometimes dull man.The Emotional Self comes into play when Andy seeks redemption. Despite the fact that Andy is innocent of the crime he is accused of committing, Andy feels that he has caused her death indirectly by not giving her enough love and attention. He says; ""I didn't pull the trigger. But I drove her away. That's why she died. Because of me, the way I am."" He feels guilty for something beyond his control, and neither he nor others know why The Shawshank Redemption takes depth in the basis of human communication; perception. Before the ending of the film, the viewer takes on almost a similar perception towards Andy as Red as the story is from Red's point of view. However, at the end of the film, the viewer learns that what we perceive about somebody or something, may turn out to be something else at the end of the day."
" As close as a film has ever come, and possibly ever will come, to perfect.
",spoiler,"In a world plagued with mediocre movies designed to sell a franchise and merchandising, rather than simply tell a captivating story, The Shawshank Redemption stands head and shoulders above any other. The manner in which it's apparent beautiful simplicity is built upon by adding layer upon layer of complex sub-stories and plot twists is absolutely unrivalled. The story centres around a central character, banker Andy Dufresne, an innocent man struggling with the injustice of being sentenced to life in prison for murdering his wife and her lover, but expands with sub stories of greed, retribution, friendship and hope in a way that would please any viewer if these plots were simply allowed to unfold alongside each other. What this film does so well though, and what elevates it from just 'good', is the way it intertwines these stories with a roller-coaster of twists and turns that give every character an utterly believable depth and requires even the most cynical viewer to dispense with the notion of 'suspension of disbelief'. Nothing is unrealistic, nothing is over the top, nothing is under explained and so nothing is unbelievable. The film is also littered with Easter egg like ironies that reward those who allow themselves to be utterly immersed within the story, such as the warden's choice of wall coverings and his words when returning an inmates bible. The film also forces viewers to empathise, not only with the protagonist, but also many of the supporting characters in a way few would imagine they could... considering the majority of them are criminals... including, it would seem, many of those who we expect not to be. In summary, on one level, if you just want a film that tells an interesting story with a happy ending, this is one you should enjoy... if you demand more from a film then this is to be considered mandatory viewing. In short, having seen this film, from plot...to acting... to cinematography, you will be left with a benchmark to measure all others by... and a sense of joy, that you will one day be presented with something even better, and a deep sense of disappointment that you know you likely never will be."
" Fantastic
",,Must see film! Great acting + plot. Well worth watching. I highly recommend everyone to see this film at least once! Tons of famous actors in this movie. One of my favorite movies of all time. This movie makes you forget about your life for a while and makes your feel like you are truly there. Experiencing the action front row! While watching the film make sure you are able to hear it clearly. No distractions ;-) Give it your full attention!
" A must watch movie
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie every one must watch, this is one of the best movies on the life in jail and the escape. The movie teaches you about importance of life and mistakes one make which cost the whole life,This movie keeps you busy from start due to its gradually increasing tempo,written beautifully and main cast performed perfectly. Overall this movie is excellent piece of work which will never grow old or out of date."
" 10/10
",spoiler,"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul"
" Great Movie
",,"I will watch again & again this movie. Great concept and fairly priced with super comfortable seats and state of the art sound! We enjoyed the movie and the food was tasty enough. The service was spotty at best with the waitress neglecting to bring us menus and forgetting to provide napkins once the food came out. The popcorn was drenched in butter even though we didn't ask for butter and the menus were filthy covered in an assortment of foods from the last guests. I love their characters, acting & story."
" A must see!
",,"Powerful, Inspirational and very moving! The writing was wonderful and the casting was exceptional in my opinion! It was very entertaining as a movie watcher/ viewer I would definitely recommend it to others. As a actor it was a great example of stillness while delivering powerful moments! Tim Robbins was exceptional with his delivery! A MUST SEE!"
" Heartfelt
",,This movie is one of the most heartfelt I've seen in a long time . Morgan Freeman and Tim Robins friendship was built upon trials & tribulations in a corrupted prison system where justice had no place to exist. This was definitely a divine connection in the most unorthodox way.
" Men's friendship is the number one subject
",,"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods."
" Greatest sleeper of all time
",,"Can I say anything more about this winner. . . Once seen, it totally speaks for itself and I shouldn't really have to say anything because when most people hear about it, they already have a pretty good idea of how incredible it is. This movie is so immaculate. My hat's off to the production company that has created not only the most inspiring film in ages, but one of the most emotionally significant films to date. The movie teaches things to us that we need to know - messages about love, perseverance, and brotherhood - and it does it with marvelous succinctness. By far, one of the greatest films I have ever seen - a masterpiece for today! Easily one of the most awesome movies I've ever seen in my life. The movie has a great message to it, the acting and filming were fantastic as well, wow!"
" time, patience and loyalty
",,"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption."
" One of the best
",spoiler,"In the beginning, I thought that the movie will be as much movies I have seen before, with a routine plot that talk on someone in some prisons try to escape with the help of a prison guard. but, what I saw is so different, a smart man worked hardly to gain his freedom without letting anyone Know What he was thinking. The movie was so hopeful and exciting, and he let you think who to use your clever in such bad situations, that was 2 hour of my life and I am so happy to having been the ""The Shaw-shank Redemption"" in my watch-list, so thank you and thank you IMDb to give me this chance to share my opinion in this movie."
" Great Movie!
",,"I'm the 2436th person to review this movie. I first saw this movie on TV while at a girl's house I was dating. I came in at about 30 minutes into the movie but I was truly captivated by the movie and I never forgot it. More than 15 years later I saw it on DVD uncut and I liked it even more. Some things I'd forgotten about from the last time I had seen it. But one thing I will never forget is the brutality of that lead guard, played by Clancy Brown. This was a movie that wanted me to abolish maximum security prisons! The violence, the rape the intimidation the corruption! It didn't start with Attica (See My Review Of Against The Wall) but has been in existence since America's founding.Tim Robbin's character had the worst luck of anyone in the world! He was at the crime scene but did not go into the room where his wife was cheating on him. He left bullets behind and then stupidly threw his gone into the river only to not have it be discovered. Had he kept his gun the ballistics would have proved that his gun was not the murder weapon. As it stands another killer did the murder and in essence got away with the crime. This led to Andy's (Robbin's Character) being convicted for a crime he did not commit.I was amazed at the inner strength that Robbin's character Andy had. He was beaten, humiliated, raped and yet was able to still persevere without losing his mind. But that's what he had in abundance. He had a mind and he used it to outwit his enemies and friends too. In many ways his escape reminded me of the two fellows who escaped from prison a few months ago in New York. It was a tenacious desire to get one's freedom from the oppression of the Man! This is why I admired Tim Robbins and his character, Andy.Redd was portrayed so well by Morgan Freeman that the story might just as well have been about him too. I'm glad that Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford were not cast in these roles. The film would have suffered I'm sure. But I will say this, the film might have done better at the box office had the title been different. Shawshank Redemption is not really a catchy title and may have turned women and some men off entirely to seeing the film. This is what at least one writer said. Despite this I give the film Four and a Half Stars. Leonard Maltin gave it Two and a Half out of Four Stars. I disagree with that but he may have been turned off by the length of the film.The author Robert A. Berman in his fantastic book Fade In: The Screen writing Process said something interesting. He said that he had read an article about films with bad titles. He said that almost every badly titled film did poorly at the box office. ""The Shawshank Redemption, which did okay in theatres, might have done more business with a better title. I passed on seeing The Shawshank Redemption in the theatres. The title just turned me off."" He went on to say that he saw it on Pay-For-View and liked it while adding that a good title can make a difference in box office sales. I concur with this observation. The title of this movie is nothing to write home about. This may have explained its average showing at the box office. Despite this, don't hold back from seeing this fine film. It's a true gem!"
" One of the most brilliant movies out there!
",,"Gut-wrenching! Beautiful! Intelligent! A masterpiece! The actors are perfect in their roles, I am surprised Tim Robbins didn't rise higher in his stardom than what he actually did after making this movie. The chemistry between him and Morgan Freeman is perfect! Every single character makes sense and seems ""real"". The dialogues are realistic as well. It portrays the corruption going on within heavily guarded facilities (such as this one) in such a simple, yet brutal way - that despite the crime committed (with a few exceptions of course) it makes you question the justice system and its fairness. I can relate to people I would never have thought I would in real life. I won't say much more about this movie, except tell you to watch it! Even if its not your type of movie, even if you tend to get bored with dramatic tales - anyone can learn something from experiencing watching it! Just be prepared to feel real human emotions. If you don't then something is seriously wrong with you!"
" awesome
",,what an amazing and motivating movie never get bored at any part of it. the music is so amazing and have you in a great movie mode. the screenplay was perfect you can never be bored from it or feel that any part wasn't in its place. Morgan freeman as great as usual never get bored from him knows when to make you laugh and when to get shocked or excited. also Tim Robbins I can't forget him since I first watched his movie Nothing to Lose with Martin Lawrence and the great amount of laughing and sorry you feel with along the movie. this movie for me is one of the iconic movies over history which I have a good memories for it and loves it so much.
" Wow
",,"The cast is superb. A real chemistry seems to bond Robbins, Freeman, and their inner circle. Will Sadler, the stone-faced bad guy in Die Hard 2, steals several scenes as the country-loving Heywood, and Vancouver native Gil Bellows shines as Tommy, the cocky high-school drop-out whose fate is pretty much sealed once we're told he has a wife and baby son waiting for him outside the prison walls. Brown, with his hair trimmed so neatly he's this close to being a dead ringer for Al Gore, displays an obsessive brutality that his Highlander role never hinted at. Freeman delivers a subtle but potent performance, letting just the teeniest dabs of despair leak through the cracks of his easy- going facade. Robbins brings the perfect mixture of fresh-faced bewilderment and canny deceit to his role as Dufresne, handling the dramatic and comic elements with equal ease. Watching these actors work together is a real treat, and they more than make up for the script's deficiencies."

" Shawshank Redemption is the best movie ever made.
",,"I saw the Shawshank Redemption with my parents when it first came out in 1994. I remember being sucked into a story that I could not stop watching. I do not want to give any spoilers, so being as vague as possible... as the story unfolds you start to wonder how the story could possibly end for Andy, and then when the crucial scene comes... wow. This movie has quite probably the best ending in movie history. An ending that has been built all the way throughout the entire movie without you even noticing. I have always thought this was the best movie ever made. When I discovered the IMDb website I was very excited to see that many people must agree with me. If you haven't already noticed, it has been given a 9.2 rating which is the #1 highest movie rating of all time."
" One of the few movies that deserve the title of ""Best Movie Of All Time"".

I was hooked from the beginning until the end of the credits, with that wonderful score by Thomas Newman.This movie will make you shiver and leave you with a strange feeling for many days. It's about friendship, it's about hope, it's about life. I believe this is one of the few movies that were flawless from beginning to end, and has one of the best endings of all time. Tim Robbins, along with Morgan Freeman, delivered one of their best performances and teached us a life lesson.It absolutely deserves the Number 1 place on IMDb's TOP 250 Movies."

Red: We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men.this is the first time i am really wand to write something about this movie even though i have watched it a hundred times, I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption.

" Great all together!

If you have not yet watched this movie sit down get some popcorn and enjoy. Parents need to know that The Shawshank Redemption is an Oscar-nominated 1994 movie based on a Stephen King story about a man sent to a maximum security prison in Maine in the 1950s who shows the other inmates perseverance and provides a sense of hope and optimism in the bleakest of places and under the most difficult of circumstances. The gritty world of Shawshank Prison is populated with sadistic guards, a corrupt warden, and predatory fellow inmates. Prison rape, while not graphically shown, is very strongly implied, with references and body positions suggesting forced anal and oral sex."

" A Timeless Classic
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless classic that has consistently been ranked as one of the greatest movies of all time. The originality of the plot, well developed characters and engrossing story keeps you glued to your seat. Watching it for the first time, the initial slow pace of the movie may baffle you but it quickly transforms into a thrilling story that makes you wonder about how life can suddenly change. It was a new experience to learn about the North American prison system and the life within the walls of a correctional facility. While watching it for a second time I was engrossed by the subtle hints at every stage of the movie that built up to a spectacular ending. This is a story of injustice, friendship, bonding, struggle, patience, sorrow, happiness and ingenuity – a true emotional roller coaster that covers you with a generous splattering of brutal truth. It teaches us to never give up on life and the importance of a meticulous long term plan for success. The movie is set in a different time but even a new generation of film viewers can certainly relate to the universal concepts that have been so beautifully featured in this film."
" good
",spoiler,"Andy is introduced to the library by Brooks in 1949. Brooks points out a Louis L'Amour section, but L'Amour's first book under his own name wasn't published until 1953 (he had written a series of Hopalong Cassidy novels in the late 1940s under the name Tex Burns), and didn't produce enough books to warrant his own section until the 1960's. He was still somewhat known having written many short stories for pulp magazines, but these featured many writers and stories. Brooks also points out a section of Reader's Digest Condensed Books, which were first published in 1950. and When Red's (Ellis Boyd Redding) parole form is stamped by the parole board, the typeface on the form is called American Typewriter which was not invented until 1974. The typeface is also not monospaced as a manual typewriter would, meaning it was most likely printed by a modern computer."
" Masterpiece!

Really well acted and a fantastic story line keeps you into this movie the whole time you watch it. It is one of those feel good stories that you have to like even if you don't like these types of movies. And this movie has one of the best endings in cinema history so this is a definite must watch. Don't deprive yourself of the pleasure of watching such a stellar movie. Go now and watch this movie if you have never seen it. Needless to say an all time great. One of the few movies you can watch over and over. The acting in incredible, the story is captivating and engaging, and every actor comes through in a big way. A truly wonderful movie. If you have not seen it, you will not be disappointed when you do."
" Not Bad, Just Overrated
",,"Frank Darabont's ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a good movie. It has a solid cast, a solid script, and solid cinematography. The film is at times engaging, moving and thrilling. You'd be hard-pressed to find anything particularly wrong with it.But that doesn't make it a great movie.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a very safe film. Not so much in terms of story, but in how it's executed. Frank Darabont directs the film competently, and seems content to stay at that level the whole time. Roger Deakins, possibly the best cinematographer working today, seems to be phoning it in, and the usually excellent Thomas Newman provides an unmemorable score. Everyone seems to be operating at three- quarters cylinder, enough to be good, but never enough to be amazing.This extends to most of the performances. Tim Robbins as the wrongfully convicted Andy Dufresne is not a particularly engaging lead. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are fun in antagonistic roles, but they've both given much better performances. The ensemble cast of prisoners is game, but very few of them are given much to do.The standout performance is easily Morgan Freeman's Red, who helps Andy navigate life in Shawshank State Penitentiary, and that has more to do with Morgan Freeman being Morgan Freeman than it does anything to do with the role.There is little wrong with ""The Shawshank Redemption"". But it takes more than having nothing wrong to make a great film. A great film requires risky decisions, new ideas or masters of their craft bringing their A-game. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has none of these, and that's not a bad thing. It's a decent film. Just not a masterpiece."
" great film
",spoiler,"yes, is most of on great film and helps to show very beauty film That is the case for most of Illumination's projects, so I must start by commending their advertising team. Although this movie was funny, the trailer seemed to showcase most of the jokes and gags seen in the movie. The new jokes that the audience hadn't seen before were more aimed toward the kids, but didn't strike the adults as much as their competing studios (Pixar, Disney, Dreamworks, etc.) usually do. With a pretty straight forward plot and a substantial amount of potty humor, I felt this film was more for the kids than for the family. The character development was very robust for the amount of characters featured in the film. There were some under developed characters, but most of the main characters were top of the line. The sewer sequences were very well lit and the animations flowed together and were very finely detailed. The movie was good and the voice actors were top notch. I would recommend if you're looking for a fun movie to watch that's not too thought provoking."
" Awesome film.
",spoiler,"In 1947 Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy is befriended by contraband smuggler, Ellis ""Red"" Redding, an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer and later a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Working in the prison laundry, Andy is regularly assaulted by ""the Sisters"" and their leader, Bogs. In 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance, and offers to help him legally shelter the money."

While the main focus revolves around Andy's character played by Tim Tobbins, you are easily affected by the side stories of those that become part of his world. All in all it is an ultimate feel good movie...an ultimate rise of the spirit in the face of tragedy and life dealing you a bad hand of cards. One of my top 5 movies of all time!"
" The best ever!
",spoiler,"When I saw that this movie was top of the IMDb top 250 charts, I was quite intrigued and wanted to watch it right away, and it didn't disappoint.The IMDb summary of the movie was quite misleading. I thought it'll just be about the friendship of Andy and Red and I was loving the movie when the real meaning of the movie came forward. It was not just a prison movie. It was a prison break movie. What a lively ending. When you see a film, you somehow anticipate that some twist is going to happen. Like the movies with crazy twists are generally thrillers or dark films and you know the twist is coming, but you are just eager to know what it is. That is not true with this movie. I would never in my right mind even imagined that there could be a twist to this movie. It is such a simple beautiful movie and then BANG!In closing, I just want to quote Andy from the film""Hope is a good thing Red, maybe the best of things. And good things never come to and end""BRILLIANT!"
" Number 1 for a reason
",,"This movie has been rated number one by IMDb for a reason. Why? What's not to like? It has everything. Crime, drama, romance, some comedy. The writers were very well set on what they wanted. They achieved it. One can watch this movie over and over. Every time I watch, I notice something new that I had not noticed before. This movie is very well written. This movie is very well produced. This movie is very well acted. This movie was very well financed. They did not need to use too much money to produce it however, one would never know. Yes. It's that good. This is definitely a movie that belongs on your shelf or in your movie collection. It's rated number one for a reason. Anyone who rates this below an eight, doesn't really know what a good movie is about. The way it's written, directed, acted, financed, produced and acted. If I had three thumbs, the would all be up. So, three thumbs up. If you've never seen this fantasias film, you're missing out. It's a must have. Enjoy."

" Outstanding

I enjoyed the entire story from the beginning to the end and I would watch this movie everyday all day because it is very outstanding compared to other movies of this age. There must have been so much work put into this production and I don't know how the actors could have performed so well!!! I have to say, I will recommend this movie to everyone I know and I won't resist the fact to talk about this movie all day! This is one of my most favorite movies of all time, o compare it to the shining and the godfather, but the shaw shank redemption comes a out on top!"
" Ultimately my favorite movie!
",spoiler,"The Shawshank Redemption stands as a truly great film. It is not an action movie, so time is taken to set up the characters. Based on a short story by Stephen King (which is truly extraordinary), the plot follows a man wrongly convicted for murdering his wife. The rest of the movie follows his time spent in Shawshank Prison. Written for the screen and directed by Frank Darabont, this movie turned out to be a box office flop; ironically, it went on to become one of the most rented movies of 1995 (similar to It's A Wonderful Life). And since then, it has become the top rated movie on this website. This movie is not action packed, but it is packed full of emotion. Beware of watching it: you may become addicted to it. And that is a good thing."
" Number 1 on IMDb...and it is easy to see why
",spoiler,"This movie...where to begin. Well it's hard to believe that when I sat down to watch this movie, that I was expecting a grim depressing movie, about how bad prison life could be. The main reason I watched it was because I am a Stephen King fan, and I heard this one was the best. So I sat down to watch it, and I was fully prepared to feel depressed, and also sad. And when I finished watching the movie, how did I feel...there is no way to say it other than: The exact opposite. I felt uplifted, happy, and after watching the ending, I simply said that this was one of the best movies I'd ever seen. What I liked about it so much is mainly the plot, and the characters. Andy Dusfrene, and Ellis 'Red' Redding are prisoners in the Eastern Maine Penitentiary, known as Shawshank. Andy spends over twenty years in the prison, Red even longer. And when I was watching I could feel (even though it is not shown physically) the years passing. The movie spends the first 3 quarters of the movie at the prison, and you really get to know it, and it's inhabitants, very well. The character you get to know best though is Andy. He is a quiet man who keeps to himself, but there is so much more to him then that. In the twenty years he spends there he manages to earn the respect of his fellow prisoners (particularly Red), the prison guards, and the cruel warden Samuel Norton. Then one day he mysteriously disappears. Or to be exact, he escapes, the first man to ever escape from that prison. It takes him twenty years to deceive all the guards, that he is a quiet honest person, that would never try to escape. During this whole time he was planning his escape, right from the start when he asked Red if he could find him (Andy) a rock pick. It took him twenty years to do all this...hat's devotion if I've ever seen it, and that's why I loved his character. Then there's the last 15-20 minutes of the film which take place outside the prison. The last 5 minutes though, when Red (who is also a fairly likable character) decides to reunite with the escaped Andy, it becomes very emotional, and a truly beautiful piece of cinema. So people say this is the best Stephen King adaptation of them all, but I think calling this movie a Stephen King movie, is like calling The Lord of the Rings a blockbuster trilogy, it just doesn't quite cut it.In fact I simply must say that this may just be the best movie ever made. It has an excellent plot, gritty and realistic setting, a sense of hopefulness (despite being a prison movies), extremely likable, and relatable characters and an ending that can truly touch the heart and soul of many viewers. It is absolutely 10/10"
" Just Great
",,"This movie really displays how horrible life in prison was in the 1900s.The guards, the warden, the facility itself. It just feels so real and almost scary for the watcher. I gave this movie a 9/10 because I found that it captured almost everything I find important in a movie. I also just love everything from Stephen King and this truly is, his masterpiece.You really get pulled into the story as it goes on and understand the thoughts and feelings of the main character.Brilliant actors, a great director and of course the man to thank it all for, Stephen King."
" hardly the best movie ever made but a masterpiece nonetheless
",,"Stephen King does create wonderful short stories and while I think his books are hardly manageable on the silver screen I think his short stories are. Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank redemption is the perfect example. With a great cast and an intriguing but not overly complex story this film has everything it needs to be a masterpiece. The actors have great chemistry together and while I don't appreciate the changes that were made, I do understand them. The director caught the feeling of the short story and created a believable experience. Some of the scenes are light hearted to an extent were you expect them to be free the next moment just to tear down this scene and show the degrading brutality of prison."
" Amazing
",,"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside."
" Redemption of the world

Whatever,whenever,wherever,people would make something mistake can't hand on.People always try to control everything but things always out of control.

" The Shawshank Redemption was a discovery of freedom, for one man whose life took an unexpected turn for the worse.

Finally having the chance to be free, it is ripped from him in a shocking discovery, he really didn't kill his wife! The Shawshank Redemption gives an ode to movie viewers and enthusiasts since the film is based on a true story. Liken the film to war veteran on the verge of escaping his enemies stronghold after years of captivity. Finally as Andy tunnels, and climbs his way to freedom, he gets the sweetest satisfaction of knowing he can now start his life again."
" One of those kind of movies which come only once in a lifetime.
",spoiler,"The review may contain spoilers!! The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that everyone will surely enjoy. The movie begins with a slow pace and as time passes you begin to love the characters and in the later part of the movie you wish it goes on and on. While watching the film, you expect a different type of ending(kind of an ordinary one). But at the end you realize that this is not an ordinary movie. The movie contains a very good message for all of us. The kind of patience and hope that Andy has is simply brilliant. Morgan has done a good job too(as usual). He has done his role as ""Red"" with complete dedication. The dialogues and background music help you to get completely involved in the movie. There are two scenes which leave you with an awe! The first one is when Andy gets out of prison by travelling through the drainage pipes and then enjoys the rain falling on him. And the second one is at the end when Red is released from the prison and Andy waits for him at a beach. My favorite dialogue is ""Remember Red, Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies."""

Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine. The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption."
" 11/10
",,"One word Masterpiece. I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie."

" Its position in IMDb top5 is not wrong !
",,"One of the finest films ever made, this movie is a sheer work of art. It's a poignant story of hope. That's what makes this film much more than just a movie. It tells a lesson about life. It's a narrative about freedom, friendship and patience. The Plot is average, but the story-telling, acting and cinematography are the reasons that make the movie, memorable. The director Frank Darabont has been flawless with his work. The story is about Andy Dufrane (played by Tim Robbings through the eyes of Red (played by Morgan Freeman, in his best role ever). Andy is wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with ""Red"" Redding and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Although nothing much happens in the way of plot for 2hours, in a movie having a playing time of 2hrs 22minutes, you would never get bored. I won't give any spoilers, in case you haven't seen it yet. Just go and watch it. You will not be disappointed. There is no way, it is highly overrated. Its topmost position in IMDb ratings is the evidence. ---------------------------------------------------------------------""All men die, not every man truly lives."""
" Only title that can do this to me
",,"The first time I saw Shawshank, I loved it and didn't want it to end. I remember that desire being surprisingly powerful, despite understanding that I had enjoyed it as much as I did while watching it. Its power surprised me because I didn't understand fully how or why I felt the way I did. On subsequent viewings, I prepared myself for the ending, for THAT feeling, which I began to examine. I would describe it as something on par with the end of a relationship, if not perfectly in scale, then certainly in context. A good relationship. One that ends too early, but does so because it must, because that is just how it is sometimes. I am always struck with a deep yearning to see more, to know and feel more, but also a comfort. That even though I didn't get everything I wanted, what I got is a damn sight good enough, and I should be grateful for that. But it aches, too. And then you realize that it's over, and you're going to wake up tomorrow, and start living your life again. But now you'll live having gone through this, with this perspective, this story in your memory. It's small, not actually the same experience, but it's close. The same shape and color. No other film, no story, gives me this feeling. And just like in relationships, sometimes I end up watching nothing but disappointing titles, I have a moment when I ask myself why I do it. That maybe I'm wasting my time. And then I remember. And then I hope."
" The greatest film ever made!!!
",,"In my opinion, The Shawshank Redemption is truly the greatest film ever made. The acting is on par and the directions is pretty darn close to perfection. The Shawshank redemption is one of those films that is designed to make you think, and boy does it do its job. The screenplay is possibly one of the greatest ever scripted. The way it cleverly weaves in and out is extraordinary. Stephen King should be proud that a film like this originated from his book. The Shawshank Redemption is the perfect movie. I don't think anyone could give it lower than a 7. The film will appeal to anyone, if not everyone, and will leave you vey satisfied long after the credits roll."
" Outstanding
",,"A film based on Stephen King's novella that rightly drew a global audience and a credit to all those involved.A plot that was well set out and professionally engineered to maximum effect, Frank Darabont again laying out new ground rules for others to follow. A story of Andy Dufresne sentenced to a term in Shawshank Prison for murder, a shame such a good film received such poor ratings from the press. the film was a masterpiece and so deserved the multiple Oscar nominations.With such a great line up including Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, David Proval, Gil Bellows, Mark Rolston, James Whitmore, Jeffrey DeMunn, Larry Brandenburg, Neil Giuntoli, its no wonder this fill many years after its launch is still drawing audiences. a job well done"
" Best movie I have seen in my life
",,"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."
" One Of The Most Inspiring And Beautiful Movies Of All Time
",,"Greetings from Lithuania.It is very hard to call ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994) a masterpiece, but it is a definitely one of the most inspiring and beautifully crafted picture off all time. That said, i won't going into details, as plot and everything about this movie is so well known. To simply put, this is a story of two men in prison sentenced to life time and their journey to redemption. Seeing this movie ~ 5 times in my life i can say that when some time passes, you kinda feel a need to re-watch it again, because this movie is like a journey itself, with characters drawn so sharply that we do care about them and the outcome is one of the most powerful and hope inspiring there is. I brake every single time when watching sequence when Brooks gets out of prison and the whole sequence of living free - it is a powerful film making so say the least.Overall, No.1 at IMDb Top 250 says a lot - this is a movie that stays with you and inspires you not to lose hope. It is flawlessly paced - at running time 2 h 20 min it never drags - it should be studied at film making universities HOW to create a film with no women characters, when action takes place inside the prison and there isn't mainstream action at all. Good things never get old, and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one the fainest examples."
" I was simply drawn in from start to finish. Quite a story.
",,"Putting yourself mentally where no one can get to you mentally. Now that's something to pull off for ourselves in a daily life habit. The pressures in a prison are a great deal more concerning than a day to day grunge and nose to the grind stone. Timothy Robbins does amazing in his role in this Movie and the support of friend made of Morgan Freemans character, solid. It really had me pulled in from beginning to end. getting more review lines in can give me an opportunity to be chatty, sure. But sometimes a movie is just a must see. The less you say. The simplistic thought of conveying there is always something more found the second time around. There's much to catch. If it's on my watchlist I've seen it and will watch it over and over.That's a great way of putting it together in wording for me."

This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption."
" This is how movies should be made.
",,The movie is about an imprisoned man who finds solace in the rarest of places and makes him deal with the harsh truths of life in a hostile environment.The movie grips you from the start and by the end of it you wonder of the innumerable things the movie relates to you with. The actors justify their characters with some remarkably awestruck performances with Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins to be some of the notable ones. Frank Darabont depicts the writing of Stephen King quite exceptionally with some amazing shots apart from a few glitches here and there the whole movie just stands out apart from the rest of the movies.

" Review
",spoiler,"In its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank Darabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked away with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were ""just happy to be nominated."" Of course hindsight is 20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all- time best. Pulp, however, was a success from the word ""go,"" making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure wasn't a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on ""that 'Rickshaw' movie."" Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, ""it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale."" But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; ""In here's where you need it most,"" he says. ""You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch."" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking ""that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass"" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it."
" Awe-inspiring
",,"One of the greatest movies ever made. Shawshank tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker convicted of his wives (and her lovers) murder. When Andy comes across inmate Red, the two form a near two decade long relationship. With Tim Robbins and Morgen Freeman in lead roles, Shawshank is an absolute masterpiece that every film lover should watch. Frank Darabont's directing is great and even more so than any of his previous work. There's really not much wrong with Shawshank. The adaptation from Stephen Kings epic novel is compelling, exciting, disheartening and inspiring. With great supporting characters, an incredible plot and stunning directing, Shawshank has become one of the greatest movies ever made. Its an absolute travesty that this didn't win the Oscar for Best Picture in 1994 although there was some stiff competition."
" The all time greatest
",,"There are very few films that can simply blow a human being's mind away but boy; Shawshank redemption does one hell of a job. From the very get go, Shawshank will have you on the edge of your seats.Tim Robbins, a man whose career was on an initial down hill slide with flops such as Howard The Duck redeemed himself and then some with his portrayal of a man who looses everything in a second and then spends 20 years trying to get it all back. Robbins gave a calm misdemeanor to his character, which always gave the impression that he had something planned, that we were not expecting. Morgan Freeman gives, in my opinion the best performance of his distinguishable career. He maintains a streetwise wisdom and this, too me, makes him the ""go to guy"" of the prison. His calm yet intelligent nature is kept through out the film and does not seem affected by Andy but after the escape, Freeman does superbly in showing the contrast in the streetwise dealer of the prison to a man who misses his friend. Thomas Newman's compelling score sets a dark and ominous tone and does what many scores don't; it reflects the thought of the characters as opposed to the tone of the scene. Darabont created a diverse prison world from the street smart ones, to the homesick ones to the rapists but I was not a fan of how racism was sidestepped in the movie. If I had one nit pick, and this is scraping the bottom of the barrel; I would have expected a few racial slurs directed at some of the prisoners, particularly Red. It would have been true of the time but then again its not the point of the story.Ultimately, Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece and has a powerful yet happy enough ending to touch the heart of anybody."
" Shawshank Redeems Cinema and How!
",,"Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free – These words inscribed on the poster of The Shawshank Redemption sum up what's at stake in Frank Darabont's chef-d'oeuvre. The Shawshank Redemption shows us that there is hope even within the restricted walls of a prison.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins)is a prominent banker wrongly convicted of killing his wife and her paramour, who spends many years in the Shawshank prison. He forges an unforgettable friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), a veteran of the penal system, who helps him to cope with the frightening realities of prison life. While the prison walls shield Red and the other prisoners from the depredations of an ever-changing world, it has the exact opposite effect on Dufresne, who exploits every possible opportunity to bring a taste of the outside world to himself and his fellow convicts. Their bond forms the backbone of the film.Tim Robbins is right at the top of his game as he paints a fascinating portrait of an unjustly incarcerated inmate and brings an innate humanity to Stephen King's principal character. Freeman is exceptional as Red and his narrative much of which is taken verbatim from King's story, holds the story together and like a skilled conductor, waves a baton to orchestrate our emotions.Frank Darabont uses his powers as a supreme storyteller and an astonishing craftsman to breathe life into a genre that I thought had been dead since The Great Escape. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, masterfully told. The film's greatest triumph is its earnestness that makes even those moments that might have felt slushy, achieve the dignity of genuine tragedy. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope that can reduce the most hardened into misty-eyed wonderment.The Shawshank Redemption warrants repeated viewing!"
" Beautiful
",spoiler,"I have seen the movie for the first time. It's a wonderful film with excellent plot twists what gives a positive effect to the enjoying of the movie. Things are happening you don't expect and that's good for a movie. It's also a dark prison-film and i like that type of films. The voice of Morgan Freeman is also very nice, and intimidating. The IMDb-rating is very high. I think the movie deserves it, but i understand other people who are thinking that this movie is overrated. I think the reason why is that this movie has less haters then other movies like Pulp Fiction, and so on... .One point can be better: the characters doesn't become older when the movie progresses.But a well-deserved 10/10."
" Mind Blowing Movie
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances. Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing.A passing reference to 'The Count of Monte Cristo' offers a partial clue to what makes this movie compelling.Top-notch performances, exceptional cinematography, and masterful direction combine to make this film something special indeed.I love this film. It's a story about hope and dreams and one whose emotional impact is as great as the Pacific Ocean is blue.http://www.quantumvisionsystempdf.com"
" Pretty much the perfect film
",,"There's nothing in life more meaningful than endlessly talking about movies, and there's no discussion as entertaining as fighting over which was the best year for films. I always go for 1994, mainly because it produced three movies that are truly unique and show up in every best of list you can imagine. I mean, it's pretty tough to find a person that doesn't have either ""Forrest Gump"", ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""The Shawshank Redemption"" in their personal top ten. While the first two movies still have a considerable group of opponents (to some people ""Forrest Gump"" is too much of a tearjerker, while ""Pulp Fiction"" apparently glorifies violence too much), ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of those movies nobody can really dislike. It's a movie that goes beyond matters of taste, the story, writing and acting are so undeniably good that it's tough to come up with a counterargument. Writer/director Frank Darabont is also a fantastic dialogue writer, particularly when it comes to bit characters. You can also see this in the somewhat inferior ""The Green Mile"", characters who only have one or two lines say the perfect line on the perfect moment. The amazing performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do the rest. The best movie ever made? It's definitely up there."
" Honestly, one of the best films I've ever seen, and quite possibly my favourite of all time.
",,"Often said to be one of the best films of all time, I can't help but agree. No matter how many times I watch this over, I feel like it never bores me and I am always captivated in a way that I've never felt with any other film before.The Shawshank Redemption is a tale of hope, courage and betrayal, seen through the eyes of prison inmates 'Andy' played by Tim Robbins, and older convict 'Red', portrayed by Morgan Freeman in an Oscar nominated performance. The film is set over 19 years in Shawshank prison, and depicts the life of Andy Dufresne, a hotshot banker and his struggle with keeping his mind and his sanity, whilst serving time for a crime he didn't commit. As Andy has to put up with harassment, distress and affliction throughout the duration of his time at the prison, the film illustrates a tale of eternal hope. As time slowly passes in the prison, he's assisted by an older inmate by the name of 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman), a black marketer who is 'known to locate certain things from time to time'. As the years pass by, Andy's friendship with Red grows and so do the hardships they have to overcome.The film itself has touched me in many ways, it shows me just what people can do when they have a little faith and keep incessant hope no matter what. Obviously, Stephen King's greatest and most memorable big screen interpretation, one of which he is almost certainly proud of. The movie is a timeless classic that speaks to me and probably a lot of others on so many levels, providing a near perfect film with a great plot line and representing a storyline with an even better message.Tim Robbins delivers an enthralling performance as the titular character, one that certainly stands out throughout the film whereas Morgan Freeman's interpretation of fellow convict Red is just as captivating, earning him recognition from the academy but not his fellow co-star Robbins, obviously yet another Oscar snub.Overall, the Shawshank Redemption speaks out to its audience, as it shows a tale of perseverance and perpetual hope when in the midst of the struggles in life. The film itself is possibly my favourite of all time and manages to keep my attention on the 10th time of watching it. A must-see for anyone who has a good taste in films and is looking for a movie that will change their perspective on life and give them the hope to pull through in the darkest of times."
" the all time best
",,"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie."
" Best movie ever
",,"This is the best movie ever but I give you 15 Things You May Not Have Known About The Shawshank Redemption1. It's Based on a Novella by Stephen King The film is based on Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,"" which was published in a short story collection called Different Seasons. Two of the other short stories in the collection were made into films, Stand By Me in 1986 and Apt Pupil in 1998. Only one of them, ""The Breathing Method,"" has not been turned into a movie.2. It's Similar to Tolstoy King's novella shares several plot points with a nine-page short story by Russian writer Leo Tolstoy called ""God Sees the Truth, But Waits."" Both are about men sent to prison for murders they didn't commit.3. Director Frank Darabont Got a Good Deal on the Rights to King's Story He bought the rights from King for $1.4. It Almost Had a Much Different Cast Castle Rock Entertainment, the studio that made Shawshank, was co-founded by Rob Reiner—director of another King adaptation, Stand By Me—and is named after the mythical Maine town that provides the setting for many of King's books. After director Frank Darabont pitched Shawshank to the studio, Reiner originally offered $2.5 million for the script to star Tom Cruise as Andy Dufresne and Harrison Ford as Red.5. The Original Title Was Changed to Avoid Confusion Darabont wrote the script in eight weeks before pitching it to Castle Rock Entertainment. He decided to drop the ""Rita Hayworth"" part of the novella because actresses sent their resumes in for consideration thinking it was a Rita Hayworth biopic. During the casting process, Darabont even received a call from an agent who represented a supermodel; he swore the script was the best she had ever read and that she'd be perfect for the (non-existent) part of Hayworth.6. It Was Filmed in Ohio Although the film is set in Maine, the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio stood in for Shawshank Prison. The structure was slated to be torn down, but the production delayed the demolition for a year. After the film wrapped, all the buildings in the complex were torn down except the cell block and main administrative building, which were preserved for historical purposes.7. Morgan Freeman Got Really Good at Catch The scene where Andy first approaches Red about the rock hammer as Red plays catch in the main yard took nine hours to shoot. Freeman continued to play catch for the whole nine hours without complaining and showed up the next day with his arm in a sling.8. The Film Was Inspired by Goodfellas Darabont says his main source of inspiration was Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas because of its use of voice-over narration and editing techniques.9. Voiceovers Are Tricky Business Originally, all of Morgan Freeman's voice-over was recorded before any of the film was shot. The fact that much of it syncs up to the on screen action (see: the scene on the roof where the inmates drink beer) isn't simple editing. Darabont would playback the recorded voice-over on-set during each take for the actors to specifically play off of the audio. But the audio quality of his voice-over was too poor to include in the movie due to tape hiss, so Freeman had to re-record the entire voice-over in post-production.10. They Got Lucky with One of the Most Famous Scenes Every take of the film's signature shot of Tim Robbins raising his arms outstretched in the rain after Andy breaks out of prison was out of focus except the one in the film. It was the final take shot for that scene.11. The Prop Guy Was a Jokester The visual joke of Andy's rock hammer being tucked into the Bible right after the first page of the Book of Exodus came from the film's prop master Tom Shaw.12. None of the Close-up Shots of Andy's Hands or Feet are Tim Robbins They're director Frank Darabont.13. Stephen King's Red Was Changed for the Film In the original novella, Red is described as a middle-aged Irishman.14. The Mug Shot of Young Red Isn't Morgan Freeman It's actually a photo of his son.15. The Tree Where Red Finds Andy's letter Isn't in Fort Hancock, Texas It's in Ohio's Malabar Farm State Park."
" Classic Movie
",spoiler,"One of the classic movie ever made. Lots of enthusiasm is shown in the movie, apart from all the suffering prisoners have to face. Must watch movie. Still capturing the box office. Shawshank is a true story and a must watch for any new member. Tim Robbins has done a fantastic job including Morgan Freeman. The Story line of the movie is really more biased then any other top bench marking movie. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."
" Best script I ever read
",,"One of the best stories on film. Acting, cinematography... it's all in there. A must see. A piece of our history as filmmakers.This story is compelling as you feel for each characters' deep struggles within a community of inmates. A range of characters excite the plot with its unexpected culture as an intimate story unfolds of secrets, shame, struggle and finally triumph. Morgan Freeman deserves an Oscar for his amazing performance and Tim Robbins executes his character flawlessly as Andy Dufresne, a man of clever who navigates his way through a sharp turn to a new way of life. This story isn't missing a morsel and keeps you on the edge of your seat with mystery, murder and the element of surprise.The Shawshank Redemption shares the ranks of the best feature screenplay I have ever read. It read unlike any other and was the kind you can't put down. Saving Private Ryan comes in at a close second. Frank Darabont is a hell of a writer and is also credited with The Green Mile and developed The Walking Dead series."
" A Masterpiece
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is most obviously one of the greatest movies in film history. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make an unforgettable duo that captures the audience in magnificent acting and a well-written plot. There was not one moment where the movie did not hold my attention or seem boring. Therefore, it indubitably earns a 10/10 and praise. A tale of two jail inmates/friends, The Shawshank Redemption shines a light on the injustice of this world and the pleasures of freedom after years of confinement. It proves that through all the troubling experiences, one man never loses sight of his dream. This not only gives Tim Robbins's character a chance of redemption but also chance for Morgan Freeman's character to be inspired by an endless struggle that pays in the end. Everyone of all ages should at one point in their lives watch this movie to witness not only great entertainment but also an inspiring story."
" One of the best films of all time
",,"I've seen this film many times before , and every time I watch it it just seems to get better! There really is nothing bad I have to say about this film , because the overlying message of the film is infinite , and it's just such a timeless classic . I can't imagine the movie without Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in their respective roles so bravo to them , because ultimately these two characters are the heart of the story. While there are some scenes that truly stand out to me , you just need to do yourself a favour a watch this amazing film. It's one of the best of all time and I can promise you that you will enjoy it !"
" The Shawshank Redemption deserves Top 1.
",,"Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."
" Is the best movie of all time
",,"Is the best movie of all time. Not only for IMDb users, but also for other rewires. This movie has it all. Suspense, drama, comedy, tenderness, friendship, etc. The photography is also magnificent. The characters are the best actor in Hollywood at that time. An incredible Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. The story is complete and has an spectacular ending. THe best ending the Hollywood made. This movie must win an Oscar, but unfortunately, Tom Hank's Forrest Gump, was more patriotic at that time and won the best picture Oscar. It is important to you don't miss this movie although you don't like prisons movie. So if you didn't see it, please rent it now. You wont regret."
" The acting was world-class
",,"im Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison."
" Shawshank=art
",,"In my opinion, The Shawshank Redemption is an amazing film in the whole way of action and how we learning from this movie. Shawshank encompasses friendship , hardship , hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going though. These artists show their capability to produce art, real art that in spires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.So, Shawshank is the must see movie in your life before you gone."
" Pure acting.
",,"If someone tells me to describe a real, entertaining movie - that would be it. 'Real' for the lack of SFX is a true bless when talking about ""The Shawshank Redemption"". I become fed up with pictures that achieve success based on the splendid job of the SFX crew or the team responsible for the CGI effects. Film's purity emphasises the importance of the act. The actors are incredible; not a single minute could be considered a bad acting (well, at least I think so). 'Entertaining' for it makes you enjoy the time spend on it and once finished there are no regrets. I am not a huge fan of Tim Robbins but the movie undoubtedly showed his talent. Mr. Freeman stays solid as usual in his act."
" Awesome movie
",,"The Shawshark Redemption is very good movie. This is a story that reflect prisons as seen by many prisoner. The Shawshark Redemption also reflect society problems. The plots and actors played very well that make me wanted to continue watch. They are very professional as a director and actor. they capture and identify with America male spirit as it shows in movie. The story is even more interesting seeing red and Andy building a relationship in a prison. Scenes are very good. Overall, this is a fantastic film.Comparing this kind of movie with other type of movie like comedy,I recommended every movie lover to watch this or you will be missing one of the best film."
" Nice Movie
",,"This movie is based on a novella by Stephen King, but don't let that put you off. It's not a horror film, rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twister of twists since The Crying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting off his goof ball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion) is shipped to the Gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank State Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a beautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to 1967. Dufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the hellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of beatings, rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire his fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red (Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given time, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to himself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in poster form. The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wise guy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams, giving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest miracle. If you're miserable enough to look for gripes then, yes, it does drift on too long and who needs prison buggery again? Yet the ending has such poetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it flopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word."

" great concept great acting great movie
",spoiler,"The Shawshank Redemtion ReviewThe Shawshank Redemption is my favourite film for many reasons. Adapted from a Stephen King novella, the film is executed brilliantly and expertly directed by Frank Darabont. The film is sad yet uplifting and has many iconic scenes. The writing is almost perfect with all the characters being well-developed. The film keeps us informed as to the lead characters' thoughts and emotions. The score was incredible with Roger Deakins cinematography and it was beautifully portrays 19 years of life in a corrupt and brutal prison. Tim Robbins delivers an incredible performance, as does Morgan Freeman. All of the supporting cast were great from the Warden to Captin Hadley. The film's ending is perfect, moving and justice for Andy delivers the feel good factor. It's a powerful film which should have dominated the Oscars."
" An interesting movie...but NOT #1
",,"An interesting movie with good performances. It's basically about hope and hold it together. It is the final outcome that matters the most.Is about 2 imprisoned men who bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency. Robbins, Freeman and the supporting cast is good enough.I don't think it is worthy to be the #1 movie in the IMDb though. That's just not possible.I know that ""debate"" started between TSR and TDK.Anyway a good overall movie. especially if you are into prison dramas, then this movie is for you."
" A classic film that everyone should see!
",,"Prison is a gloomy and dark place that can contain beauty if worked on. Friendships can be formed, enjoyment can be experienced, and freedom can sometimes be felt. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a very popular film that contains world class film-making and interesting life-lessons that can be applied from prison to the free world. Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a banker who is convicted of murdering his wife, a crime he didn't commit. After being sent to the Shawshank State Penitentiary in Maine, Andy encounters some tough people including a brutal prison guard and ruthless prisoners and lives in constant fear. Andy soon meets Red, a contraband smuggler with a life sentence played by Morgan Freeman in the greatest performance of his life. The two form a special friendship and find how to make the best of their situation. As the men get different jobs in the prison, attempt escape, and experience different feelings, the men try to redeem this depressing prison and find a better life. This story is an absolute cinematic icon and there is no questioning as to why this is a classic work of art. The friendship formed between Andy and Red is one of the most fascinating things to watch form in cinema, as we get elaborate character development and watch the unfolding of a beautiful friendship come to life in a depressing location. The extra tad's such as the use of foreshadowing and flashbacks writer Frank Darabont uses creative detail and complexity to make this story special. Darabont also directs this film and portrays a prison life in shockingly unique ways. He focuses on all the hardships that make prison seem nightmarish, but also shows how prison can be the best place on earth when you have a friend and enjoyment in difficult situations. The themes of persistence and hope that are brought up in this film can relate to anyone's situation whether free or in prison. Darabont adapts Stephen King's story to show us how in order to live we need freedom, and without hope you will never achieve it. This is a classic example of pure 90's film-making and stands as one of the best classics of all time. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of the greatest narrative stories ever told and brings so much up that can inspire the world on how to achieve meaning in life."
" Best of Hollywood creation ever.....
",,"when i started watching shawshank redemption ,i think it's a kind of slow movie type about a an investment banker who's role played by Tim Robbins one of most acclaimed actor of her genre , accused in the murder of her wife , by identifying the affairs with other guy , and come jail of shawshank and her in jail the actor face so many difficulty by jail's offcials , fellow criminals , and also get few a nice friends including Morgan freeman . Tim Robbins who just get deep into character and play role with excellence , as the story movie the role of actors are get more intense , and as Tim Robbins who initially afraid but on the other part he get more calm and relaxed and determine and managed to survive and working on her secret plan , when you watch this scene you get blanked , you never thought of such thing happy in the movie , it surprise suspense just leave with a question mark on her mind in every seconds , at last Tim Robbins successful in task and reveal the liking of Marley Munro in the movie .i like story of shawshank redemption and its characeters ......"
" Courage, Patience, and Determination
",spoiler,"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that shows courage, patience, and determination. We sometimes see some things as impossible, but with persistence and determination, we can achieve something. The story of the movie is really shocking. We may find it boring on the early part but you would just surprise on the turn of events as the movie plays through. You will really would not believe that a certain person could make a hole so long that you can make a way out. I can't still imagine how the main character made it. Well in life nothing is impossible as long as we want it happen. We must only believe of what we can do so we can be productive and successful. This movie is really worth watching. You may find it boring on the early part, don't be bothered, finish it, surely you will enjoy."
" Bloody fantastic
",,"The film's been IMDb's #1 for as long as I can remember. That doesn't really raise my expectations, considering I don't agree with so many inclusions or exclusions. I thought this was absolutely fantastic. Yes, it's pretty sentimental in a big way, but unlike that year's Best Picture winner, it tells a captivating, simple yet intriguing story that manages to earn its emotion with some really heartfelt characters and superb writing. It's hard to hold anything against it (if you liked it, of course) when it's so unpretentious and gentle. Freeman is fantastic, unsurprisingly, but Tim Robbins is so bloody brilliant in this. Watching Rectify now, Aiden Young seems to be playing in the same ballpark in terms of the similarity in his portrayal."
" Performance of a Lifetime from Tim Robbins
",spoiler,"This isn't the type of movie that I would normally rave about. It's about the triumph of hope over despair, and friendship over division - it's a feel good movie.But the truth is I think The Shawshank Redemption is absolutely fantastic. When I try to put my finger on why I like this more than other feel good movies, I think it's largely because of the wonderful collision of brilliant characterisation and top-class performing that is Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins.The character of Andy - humble but steely, quiet but intelligent, simple but cunning - is just perfect for this movie. He's so different to almost any other prison break character you can imagine, and extremely engaging. And Tim Robbins is the perfect casting - he puts in the performance of a lifetime.Tim is very well supporting by Morgan Freeman as Red, and in fact the entire supporting cast does their job.The plot is interesting - it consists of a series of successes and falls for Andy. He keeps on picking himself and dusting himself down. You end up assuming that it's all going to end tragically, which I suppose why his final, spectacular triumph is so uplifting. Yes, it's unrealistic, but it certainly won me over!"
" All time movie
",,"There is nothing more to say about this film: MUST BE WATCHED. As it will guide you into feeling that no other shot will. You will find a perfect line combination between two big faces: Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Where large chats will make you think and rethink about everything you though in your life. What's the real point of living? Are my problems serious enough to be worried about? We all should try harder finding the important little things on life that will make us happy, true happy.Moreover, we can find almost-perfect technique on screening every single shot from Frank Darabont. Releasing the true original idea from writer Stephen King.Sit, and enjoy."
" One of the best film about prison's life
",,"When I watched this film at first time, I focused very much. Screenplay is very fluent and well-designed. The most significant point for this film, in my opinion related to actors or characters as Andy Dufrense and Red. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman played very convincing. I know leading role was offered Tom Hanks. But I am very satisfied Tim Robbins played this good role. On the other hand this film didn't have any awards as Academy and Golden Globe. This fact trouble me. I think the most splendid episode in this film: when guards call the roll in the morning everybody exits their rooms expect Andy and most of people suppose that (as me) he committed suicide but he left. All in all nobody can deny that the biggest success was off the director of film Frank Darabont."
" Beethoven's String Quartet No. 15 Movement III ""Heiliger Dankgesang""
",,"I can't remember how I ended up watching ""The Shawshank Redemption"" it's been many years. I can't remember how many times I have watched it. I am not sure what ""new"" I can say about this movie, so let me say something simple. What I say will make sense to musicians and music lovers specifically those who adore Beethoven. This is what is to movies, what is Beethoven's String Quartet No. 15 Movement III ""Heiliger Dankgesang"" is to music. Thanks. I thought of keeping it simple, but it seems there is a rule that I should write 10 lines. So let me say if not for this movie and of course Beethoven's ""Heiliger Dankgesang"" I would have committed suicide."
" Excellent film
",,"An excellent film , from my point of view develops many aspects of life such as freedom , fraternity , will, repentance ... embodied in all the characters that make up the group of prisoners related to the protagonist , and in contrast to these positive character issues , we also show the abuse of power , selfishness , lack of ethics, lack of empathy ... sins embodied mainly in the 2 bad function : the warden and the head of the guards (the "" Kurgan "" from ""Highlander"" ) .The development of these human issues is completed by a classic story of survival in prison , seen in previous films and of course many post "" The Shawshank Redemption "" with a spectacular climax in the form of happy ending , which will serve to please all those people who for one reason or another are not interested in the ""other issues "" movie .How could it be otherwise , being a cinematic masterpiece , terrific performances from the entire cast .Greetings friends !"
" Freeman gives it depth
",,"Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He always professes his innocence, but is thrown into Shawshank Prison with other lifers like Red (Morgan Freeman).Director Frank Darabont has made a prison fable out of a Stephen King short story. It is well acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Freeman is especially important as he is the narrator and the POV of the story. It's his lyrical voice that makes this fable compelling. It could have easily been a simple prison movie that rang hollow. Freeman gave the readings depth.If there is one complaint, it is Andy's claim of innocence. It needs to be shown early on during the trial. Instead, we derived mostly from Andy's demeanor. It needs to be a big declaration at the beginning. When Tommy (Gil Bellows) tells the story, he should include one detail from the trial like the 8 bullets. That way, the audience can get an aha moment. It's a minor point, and overall this is a good prison fable."
" Neat story. Simply genius.
",,"A friend of mine who unbelievably loves movies, share an information about this movie by the time i won a local short film award in Indonesia. He simply said that this is a must-see movie for a director or DP. So i tried hard to search for this film and finally found it. Before seeing the movie, i read the credit title that impressed me instantly. I thought ""this is not gonna be bad at all"". From the very first scene to the last of it, I can only comment that this film really inspires me to write, produce and direct a neat story telling concept with a surprising ending. No wonder it gets the highest rated film here because the moment i reached the ending, i can only WOW it. Genius!"
" Without a doubt one of the best masterpiece of all time !!!
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen.What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys.It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."
" Nice
",,"Talk about your school of hard knocks. In The Shawshank Redemption (Columbia, R), Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a tall, soft-spoken New England banker, is convicted-wrong- ly-of killing his adulterous wife and her lover. It's 1947, and Andy, having received a double life sentence, is shipped off to Shawshank State Prison in Maine, a maximum-security fortress packed to the grimy gills with thieves, rapists, and murderers. How bad is life at Shawshank? So bad that when Andy trudges off the bus along with a dozen other new inmates, the veteran prisoners make wagers on who'll be the first to cry. So bad that Andy finds a huge, wriggly yellow maggot buried in his lunch. So bad that, over the next two years, he is systematically beaten and raped by the Sisters, a crew of leering renegade inmates who take special delight in tormenting their fellow prisoners. Make no mistake: Andy gets worked over-and so does the audience.But then, good things have a way of happening to unfortunate movie characters. Early in his stay, Andy makes the acquaintance of Red (Morgan Freeman), a sly survivor who is serving a life sentence for murder and who acts as Shawshank's one-man black market, smuggling the prisoners anything they want-cigarettes, reefer, cards with naked ladies (''I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck,'' he deadpans). As soon as Andy bonds with Red, things start to ! look up. He gets hold of a rock hammer so that he can sculpt an elegant chess set. He does the guards' tax returns in exchange for perks like beer on a sunbaked afternoon. He expands the dusty, neglected book room into the most comprehensive prison library in New England. Set over a period of 20 years (the passing decades are marked by Andy's pinup posters of Rita Hayworth, then Marilyn, then Raquel), The Shawshank Redemption begins as a nightmare, a postwar- New England Midnight Express, but it doesn't take long to reveal its true, feel-good colors. The movie is about survival, triumph, and a thing called hope. It's about a hero who rises above the squalor because he's blessed-a saint in the muck. It's Midnight Express Goes Gump.You need a certain craftsmanship to traffic in twin brands of manipulation- the exploitative and the sentimental-and there's no denying that Frank Darabont, who wrote and directed The Shawshank Redemption (it's based on a short novel by Stephen King), knows just what he's doing. The moss-dark, saturated images have a redolent sensuality; you feel as if you could reach out and touch the prison walls. And Darabont is an accomplished button pusher. He coaches the actors so that you always know exactly who to root for and against. When it comes to a character like the warden (Bob Gunton), all Bible- thumping righteousness, the movie has no compunction about turning up the hissability factor. He starts out mean, then turns meaner, then meaner still. When Andy blasts Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro over loudspeakers to the prison work field, it becomes a full-scale opera-soothes-the-savage-breast number, with the prisoners standing open-mouthed at the sublime sounds. The scene is meant to fire our righteous liberal hearts. It helps, of course, that most of the prisoners don't actually behave like criminals. They never say a word about their pasts-even Andy remains a downtrodden cipher-and this lends the proceedings a hollow, generic feel, as if Darabont had constructed a blueprint out of old prison melodramas.A movie like The Shawshank Redemption, with its brazenly mechanical plotting and its wish-fulfillment finale, requires a lead actor who can carry us on the wings of his good spirits. Tim Robbins is crafty and likable when Andy is hoodwinking the guards, and he makes you feel the character's mute anguish. Yet in shouldering what is essentially a laconic- good-guy, neo-Gary Cooper role, Robbins never quite makes emotional contact with the audience. His face, foggy and placid, suggests an overgrown baby's; there's something naggingly unformed about him. Morgan Freeman, on the other hand, with his delicate smolder, his eyes that seem to peer directly into everyone's soul, makes Red feel genuine, lived-in. Speaking of the prison walls, he says, ''First you hate 'em. Then you get used to 'em.After long enough, you get so you depend on 'em. That's institutionalized.'' With his gift for rapt pauses, for caressing just the right syllable, Freeman can make a speech like that sound like one of the philosophical nuggets of the ages. Then again, isn't it time Morgan Freeman stopped playing the soulful sidekick? While we're on the subject of prison walls, an actor as great as he is shouldn't get too used to movies like this one. B-"
" My Favorite Movie of All-time
",,"Enough has been said of this masterpiece, so I'll keep my review succinct. This truly is my favorite movie of all-time, because no matter how many times I see it, I still get the genuine feeling of hope the film has delivered since the first time I saw it. Everything about this movie is perfect; from the cinematography, to the acting, the casting, the writing...everything. It's a fantastic example of the power of hope and the true nature of the human spirit. When you watch it, you just know that every scene is classic; so many moments will be remembered forever in film history. If anything, it just keep getting better with each time I see it. I will continue to enjoy this film for the rest of my life."
" Very very well
",spoiler,"The Shawshank Redemption is a magnificent film, and I love love always, but this overrated, apparently there are three visions current world, those who believe that citing Kane is the best movie of film history. 2 say it is a life sentence for the popular media vote, and those who believe other things and mostly know that there is the best movie in the world. Without a doubt, one biennium film, the protagonist is a character you acutes very easily and that story is impossible that you are not put goosebumps. The cast Maimonides as the rest of the movie. Not die without seeing this masterpiece. It's the kind of movies I want to find me when I rush to see one or when payment movie to see, for this reason I put it a 10."
" Shawshank Redemption
",,"In this movie a man is mistakenly accused in murdering his wife and her boyfriend. He ends up finding away to keep himself occupy and finally helps out his new found friend.I really like this movie, because it does show you that the system can make a mistake just like everyone can. All people make mistakes and since the government is run by humans of course there are going to be flaws. I had watched this movie for the first time with my dad and I loved watching it since. It does show that when you are determined you can do anything you put your mind to.I think anyone who likes movies about prison or even about the judicial system will love this film."
" Powerful, poignant, thought-provoking
",,"Well what can I say but, Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. Powerful, poignant, thought-provoking and finally irresistibly uplifting. The Shawshank Redemption works not only as an excellent prison drama, but as a metaphor for overcoming our own private prisons.An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well! I have not read Stephen King's novella (his first non-horror), but some of the movie's deficiencies, such as the old-fashioned morality tale and portentous message about camaraderie and redemption--must have been in the source material."
" A ""watch over and over"" film
",,"Whenever this movie comes on I have to watch it. This movie is very compelling and if you have not seen it I'm not going say much to spoil it for you. This movie takes place over a few decades of wrongful imprisonment of a banker who is accused of killing his wife. The time spent in prison is sought with so many horrors as I saw it especially for a man who never should have been imprisoned. The end is great and after the movie is over they just leaving you hanging on a ""What's next"" Like no other. I have seen many movies leaving you or trying to leave you hanging but every time I see the Shawshank Redemption I wonder what occurred after the beach."
" Intelligent films
",,"This movie was really well done 100% through. It is one of those films that is a classic because it is a powerful story, but it's also an intelligent film. We don't see that too much, and I hope to see more films like this! It makes me think of the essence of filmmaking and storytelling, and how much that aspect of our industry is really honored. Every Director wants to tell a great story, but few let the story tell itself. This is an intelligent film because it gets so involved with our character driven plot lines that you forget you're watching a movie at all. As a young filmmaker, this film is a fantastic model to build a foundation around. Let's just hope studio thoughts don't pick up and they try to make a sequel/prequel..."

" A Good Movie
",,"In 1947, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth, followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. Andy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the ""bull queer"" gang ""the Sisters"" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston).In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a pretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice and expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from nearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decrepit library.In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his receiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that he holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him, but Red dismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias ""Randall Stephens"".In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for burglary. He joins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In 1966, after hearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy reveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and preferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary confinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being unrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a specific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package.The next day at roll call, upon finding Andy's cell empty, an irate Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. The rock tears through the poster, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and the prison's sewage pipe with Norton's ledger, containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him the following morning, Andy, posing as Randall Stephens, visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money. Finally, he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.After serving 40 years, Red receives parole. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo, he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited."
" Not a film but a journey of the inner workings of the human soul
",,"Without doubt one of the most endearing stories to touch the human soul. Very rare a film succeeds in taking the mantle away from the novel. However this is one of those cases when it simply just does.This soul finding, awe inspiring against all the odds film is a great adaptation of Stephen King's 1982 Novella entitled 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption'.This is the film that will make you think that there is hope in the world and that with great perseverance 'anything can be over come'. Set in the times of what looks like the depression and located within the backdrop of the sleepy south of America.A man sent to prison for life for a crime he did not commit, and how this alien world of the lower reaches of society seem at first that he will be broken and beaten and either die or go mad (as so many of the inmates succumb to). As Simon and Garfunkel had their books and poetry 'to protect them (me)' so the lead character Andy Dufresne has his to protect him from such failings. In Rita Hayworth he has a passage of physical escape as opposed to the virtual world of books. He gains respect over time not through physical violence but by the craft of his mind and sheer willpower. Like a chess master he is thinking several moves ahead of everyone. Even the old master lag played by Morgan Freeman can only watch this man from a distance. However he relays through mainly past tense commentary how this man was as GB Shaw would say was 'Superman'. Eventually like a great master he exposes the lies,hypocrisy and greed of the evil church going warden. This is not a film but a journey to the very survival of the human soul and as the lead character passes through leads a golden light on those condemned even if only for a passing moment in time. Like a bird on a journey he is destined to be free. Enjoy this film because it may if only for a moment save your soul."
" An outstanding movie!

When I saw this movie I was amazed because of the plot of this movie and that was something that made this movie so special.I also liked this movie very much because of the cast of this movie. Tim Robbins (Andy Dufresne) and Morgan Freeman (Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding) made one of the best performances of their life. Deserves to be noted that Bob Gunton (Warden Norton) made an also good performance.I really recommend this movie to you and I am sure that you will love it because it's a movie that can teach you many things about life and the relationships between people and friends."

" Review
",,"One of the best and must watch movie which i ever enjoyed....Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie."
" again and again
",,"The more times you watch it, the more you love it, and the more you learn from it. An absolutely encouraging story to those who are desperate or sad or complaining about bad luck. If you never give up and try to figure out a way ahead, nothing can stop you to the brightness and freedom. Everything you have experienced will bring you positive influences if you take it positively. I have watched it for many times, at least ten times I guess. Now I hope I can download it and keep it and enjoy it once I have time. I used it to encourage people around me, for example, a girl friend who's suffering from the depression, a workmate who has just lost his favorite pet, and a friend who lost his job recently."

",spoiler,"This was a reflection of the 'count of Montecristo', especially the jailbreak scene. But still i find it fascinating enough to impress me and have a lot of ingredient included in it. This is probably the most amazing movies from the nineties apart from Forrestgump and back to the future and all. It also reminded me of the series The Oz, Its cool and all, but there's this mainstream way of showing jail and high school as the same in Hollywood a lot. probably so but i'm afraid that not to be true.And one more thing i noticed was that viewers seems to be confused a number of times as the story slips from one another scene and is really complicated. that is it started as a man who have been betrayed by his love to who've been framed then jailed bitched from there and rules there becomes everyone's favorite and the warden becomes his worst enemy and teaches him a lesson while he was on the go."
" Good
",,"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"".The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want."
" Probably the best movie ever
",spoiler,"There is a reason the Shawshank Redemption has been at #1 of the IMDb top 250 for as long as I can remember. It is probably the best movie that has ever been made. Not because of the thrilling special effects (it hardly has any). Not because of the daring, experimental innovations it has brought us (it is a quite straightforward movie). But because of its simple, beautiful storyline and its great characters.""They send you here for life. That's exactly what they take."" The strength of this movie is that Darabont is able to show what it means to completely lose are perspective and dreams for the future. To show how the people inside shed off their old lives and get used to the terrible life in Shawshank prison. We can truly understand how a man can become 'institutionalized.' How people get used to living under a repressive regime and can't face changing it. We see how the old Brooks can't deal with the world around him and commits suicide. How Red faces the same challenges when he can't take a leak without asking permission. Inside the joint these men had a certain standing, they were important people. Being set free is not easy when your live has been taken from you.""Why did you do it? - I didn't, since you ask. - You gonna fit right in.""Half of the movie we don't know for sure whether Andy is guilty or not. It doesn't matter so much. What is important is not his past. Rehabilitated? What does that word even mean? In prison you live a whole different life. With whole different rules. Without a past. Or a future. Andy is the exemption. He shows us the remedy against becoming institutionalized. By never accepting our destiny. By never giving up. By always keeping our dreams alive.""- There are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. There is something inside that they can't touch. - What are you talking about? -Hope. - Let me tell you something my friend, hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane. You better get used to that idea.""But Andy doesn't get used to that idea. He has received two things by the warden. ""Discipline and the bible."" And he uses these two things to get out and escape to the paradise called Zihujataneo. There are two things that make this movie so extremely good. The first thing is that we all can relate to Andy. ""I must admit, I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him. He had a quit way about him. A walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here.""Andy is a normal guy. He is smart, he is doing good. But he is not extremely strong, or extremely smart, or extremely rich. In other words: he is us. He is elevated a little bit above the criminals in prison, but his two most important characteristics are characteristics that, deep down inside us, we all have: hope and determination. These two emotion are so strong and so pure, that we all love to see the live of Andy. That is what makes this movie so appealing.And by living just your live as best as you can, by never giving up and by keeping your dignity at all times, we see that we can inspire people. Brooks was here. So was Red. Red didn't choose that path of Brooks. Red hasn't become completely institutionalized. Because he lived with Andy and dreamed a bit of his dreams.We, the normal movie-watchers, have never been to prison. And certainly, there is nobody who can play the role of an older brother as the great Morgan Freeman, and this might be his best performance of his live. Darabont shows a lot of skill in movie-directing and can let years pass in his movie without one moment losing our attention. There is a great soundtrack, which breathes the smell of Southern America into our living rooms. But I'm convinced that what makes this movie so great is that it inspires us all.We are not stuck in a prison, but certainly we can be stuck in our lives. Change is hard and also outside of prison it is possible to become institutionalized. We can have a life that seems to have no past and not future. That seems to be unrelated to all the other things that happen in the world. Andy learns us to never give up. To never lose faith. To always keep hoping and dreaming about paradise.""I guess it comes down to a simple choice. Get busy living or get busy dying."""
" Shawshank redemption
",spoiler,This movie is the best of all times.All the actors are in their high limits of their performs.When you are watching the movie you just feel you are in that prison and living all these things like they suffered all the pains.And I need to say something about Morgan Freeman.His voice and his role is perfect in this movie. you are just watching out of breath during the movie.I don't know but maybe I watched this movie more than three and every time ı am finding new things that ı couldn't see before.Also the story is unique and different than other prison movies.I am describing in that way because before and after this film there are a lot of movies about prison life.To give this prison life emotions you need to find some specific things which would grab audiences' attention.

" Definitely one of Hollywood's most iconic films...
",spoiler,"""I wish I could tell you that Andy fought the good fight, and the Sisters let him be. I wish I could tell you that - but prison is no fairy-tale world."". I think this line by Morgan Freeman pretty much sums up the whole film! Amazing film written by one of the most interesting writers of our time. Steven King, who is often known for giving us fantastical horror stories, brings to the table one of the most realistic terror tales imaginable. Andy, a banker, finds himself accused of a crime, and is sent to prison. There, he is faced with the challenges of survival while maintaining hope, to one day find his freedom. In his journey he makes an unlikely bond with fellow inmates and is able to enlighten them with things they never dreamed possible. This is a definite must see film."
" A perfect movie!!
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies I have seen in sometime. The first time I saw it was in my Film & Literature class and I loved it from start to finish. It keeps you thinking and even if you read the novella, there is changes to it. There are many foreshadowing in it that could help you figure out what's happening later in the story and overall. Many film fans should check it out and even later buy it if you want. The film also has many likable characters as well and you'll have some of those funny moments (but not a lot). It's a movie that you'll watch again and again.Stars: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Mark Rolston. Year: 1994"
" The Best Movie Ever
",,"Truly a masterpiece. This is one of those movies which you can watch over and over again and still find it as moving as the first time you watched it. This film can not be replicated, because the film is special; the Director wanted to make a piece of art of his film. The movie has no bad points it's what a story should be about, it takes you somewhere that you never been, and makes you feel you lived that experience, and you can learn from that experience. The lines delivered, will always be remembered 'Get busy living, or get busy dying' (this is the dilemma we face in everyday live). For this I give this movie a 10/10 and strongly recommend you to see it."
" Best movie ever
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances.The screenplay was written by Frank Darabont, who based it on the novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King. He adapts the material so well that he really transcends it, turning the film into a work of art. Many avid readers will claim the book is always better than the movie, but that is simply not the case here. King is a tremendous writer, but even he can't shade and color the prison the way that Darabont does, which sets the mood for the entire film. The characters King created in the book are deeper and more well drawn in the film in large part because of Darabont's script. Many moviegoers turn their noses up at the thought of a movie about the triumph of the human spirit. However, even those jaded film fans will love ""The Shawshank Redemption"" because it sets a new standard for films in this genre. It is an unapologetically emotional and sometimes sentimental take on friendship and life, even when that life is spent in a cage, and will make viewers laugh, cry, and reflect on their own lives in ways that very few movies can. It may not have won a single Oscar, but it will win your heart, and perhaps that is more important."
" Excellent! Beaware of Inst-man-cry.
",,"This is a different one... at least from the kind of movie I'm used to watch in sync with friends. Because the 'action' in the plot is around mystery and complex characters. The movie omits most of the stuff so you do the work, including the emotional work, and that I value greatly in a movie. Movies that make you feel and think, that are not obvious and bogus are the ones you should watch. Directors that don't tell you in each scene exactly the actors are feeling and thinking... no. You need adventures through each history, through realms of thought. Those are the ones you should watch. I don't want to go deep in the movie to avoid spoilers, since I write reviews for guys to decide if they are going to watch. So here is the tip: If you are looking for fun this might not be you guy. You will cry and I don't like that when movie syncing with friends. But if you want to know a history well developed around emotion, and some really funny nice characters, or even some of Morgan freeman then you should do this."

" hope....is greatest thing
",,"i watched this movie a 10 times...still not a bit bored..this is the most Beuiful and greatest movie...the screenplay is perfect and the actors are performing just like the prisoners in the jail.The casting of the movie is just perfectly great,i can't think anyone other than the those actors in respective roles.Tim Robbins and Morgan freeman is just great to watch.If you didn't watched this movie you have just lost something...hope...the greatest of things...the movie starts with Tim Robbins sent into the jail for murdering his wife and lover..and imprisoned for two life sentence.he has seen worried in the beginning but he retains hope to survive.When i watched the climax when Andy escapes from the prison i can't believe the moment and i rewind it for another ten times..just incredible movie"
" The shawshank redemption
",spoiler,The Shaw shank redemption is a movie that you should see this movie is set in the 40s-50s and it's about a man (Tim Robbins) who goes to prison for something he did not do and along the way Tim meets another man during the film (Morgan Freeman). I think Morgan freeman is the perfect actor for this film he was just amazing and I love his voice it's so good. Anyway about the film it's about two hrs and a half long and that's a pretty long film. Through out the film Mr robbins does somethings to change the prison like one scene he makes a huge change to the library at the prison and he teaches one of the prisoners how to read and do math equations. Also he does taxes for the guards in the prison and he loses some good friends along the way and the ending was just fantastic I just loved it and the ending goes something like this: Mr robbins has just escaped and is on the beach cleaning up a boat and then he sees his mate from prison Mr freeman who was let free from prison and they both see each other on the beach and they run at each other and hug. Overall I just loved it even though the movie can be violent and sad at times i would watch this film again lots of times. Anyone that has not here is the trailer : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hB3S9bIaco. My name is Henry and if you want to see more reviews check out my page but for now goodbye.
" Get busy living or get busy watching this masterpiece...That's god-dam right!
",,"One of the masterpieces of Stephen King that became another memorable masterpiece for movies (and one of the most underrated films by the Academy).""Shawshank Redemption"" is one of the most magnificent and beautiful films ever made, is not the first time that another work of Stephen King becomes a must see classic. Thanks to Frank Darabont, the film became unforgettable and also thanks to the magnificent history. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a simple and shy bank worker, who after seeing his wife with her lover, he threats to kill her. His wife and her lover show up dead in the next day and Andy is sentenced to life imprisonment in Shawshank institute where begins his great life story when he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and a strong friendship starts between this two during the long years of imprisonment. Andy manages to bring many benefits to the prison and the prisoners, but only later that Andy discovers that his arrest was all a ""misunderstanding.""The strongest points of the film is the screenplay of Darabont writing and detailing the film with greater mastery possible by putting us in the place of Andy and get us feeling the tightness and claustrophobia of prison. But at the same time with a very well-constructed dialog that narrates the film without blemish and without leaving any loose end, leaving the story and his final message in greater perfection. A story that teaches the value of friendship and strong at the same time of hope, one of the beautiful things in life and that we can never abandon it or forget it.Not only the story is absolutely amazing and without any flaws, but the performances of each of the cast stand out, Morgan Freeman being perfect as in all his roles. But who stands out is definitely Tim Robbins with a show of perfection while maintaining its character as it is, shy and who keeps to himself and does not try to be anything more than that.A film that is undoubtedly magnificent, a true masterpiece that should be watched over and over again to witness this spectacle emotionally breathtaking classic."
" MASTERPIECE*, THE BEST* Ethical, Life-displaying, Heart-aching,
",,"""The true masterpiece"" This movie has a quite way defining the life, struggles, deep happiness and sadness. The director has completely understood the movie and so all his efforts we can see here.Nothing less than a Divine Gift to the World. Once anyone sees definitely he is going to repeat it a lot often.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and Red (Morgan Freeman) both have best performances. The best ending scene of this movie I have ever scene showing kind of Deja-Vu and Divine feeling to me. It is the movie about friendship and slow-redemption. You might not blink for a second to see what next it would lead to. Each character is fitted to their roles perfectly and they have given a flawless justification to that. A prison life is depicted in this movie which is looks vivid. I would say that this movie is aptly rated. This movie has a way to touch your heart by means of showing a true Hope."
" It is a story of an innocent man's sojourn to the prison and how it affects him and his fellow inmates.
",,"Every once in a while you come across a movie which touches your heart in a way you cannot describe. It moves you and affects your take on life. This is one such movie. It will fill you with an undefinable happiness and you'll never be able to get enough of it. The Acting: Splendid acting by Tim Robbins. He carries the role of an educated lawyer partial to music with enviable charm and subtlety. Morgan Freeman of course is as good as ever. His narrations are always a cherry on the cake.The Soundtrack: An elegantly restrained balance between the grim tones of the Shawshank Prison and the more melodic influences of hope. Perfectly in conjunction with the acting.I hope anyone who hasn't seen this movie, sees it. ""I Hope..."""
" A Breathtaking Story and an Outstanding Cast,
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is a phenomenal movie with a very well developed storyline, outstanding character development and a fantastic cast. It's almost immediately engaging, I found myself engrossed by the story from the very first scene, as we follow Andy Dufresne in his journey in to prison, we feel the characters emotions, even without them being properly exposed and as the film progresses we see him form relationships in Shawshank prison that add a lot of depth. The character development in this movie is ridiculously well written and is what writers should look towards as inspiration, the relationship between Andy and Red, Brooks' entire story arch, the Warden and Captain's partnership, it's all very believable, as well as captivating thanks to a terrific script by Frank Darabont. The performances are all absolutely outstanding, Tim Robbins emotional, enclosed personality as Andy is terrific, Bob Gunton's sinister delivery, Clancy Brown's threatening persona, James Whitmore's innocent, uneducated attitude, it all comes together to create engaging, realistic people. However, the undeniable star of the show, and the main reason this film is #1 on IMDb's Top 250 has to be Morgan Freeman, his portrayal of Red is immediately enticing, he's a pure, honest man who keeps the story moving with narration, Freeman's voice-over work for this film adds that extra layer that was very necessary and added so much more power, his dialogue with Robbins is some of the best acting I have ever seen, and the moment in which he speaks about his parole for the final time is possibly the highlight of this amazing actors entire career. Very engaging, emotional, The Shawshank Redemption is a long movie, but I never found myself wanting it to end, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama. Andy Dufresne is sentenced to two lifetimes in prison when he is convicted for killing his wife and her secret lover. He is miserable in Shawshank prison, but soon makes friends in the wise Red. Best Performance: Morgan Freeman"
" What an experience ..
",,"This movie captures many of things that made us love movies in the first place! It is a movie that contains many beautiful messages about life in general and how we should always be grateful for what we have, it's about friendship, it's about dedication and determination! It teaches that we can find beauty in the most difficult situations and places. I rated this movie 10/10 because I seriously couldn't find any flaw, the direction, script, acting, production values, and acting. What I like about this movie is that's all about humans, it's about the simple human needs that we seek, freedom, love, respect, power, friendship, health, fairness and justice. This movie is great because it can reach to any human being regardless of their background or history or preference, it will touch you so deep!"
" A Cinematic Masterpiece!!!
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is a cinematic masterpiece. Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. Andy Defrain escapes from prison by digging a hole in the wall that is hidden under the poster of the model. Warden and Brookes commit suicide and Baron gets sent to jail. Lastly, morgan freemans character is set free."
" I finally understand why this is the #1 movie on IMDb
",,"I've seen this film on IMDb so many times before on so many people's lists. But I just ignored it because I thought it was not what I was looking for. When I finally decided to see it, I immediately regretted not watching it any sooner. The film is heartbreaking and frustrating from the start, but in the end, you would truly feel redemption. You could feel the pain and injustice brought upon Andy, the protagonist. As I watched the movie, I felt as if I was in prison with him; I felt as if I've gone through the struggles that he went through as well. You could see how time is irrelevant in prison; you feel minutes go by when it's actually days, weeks, months, and years. And then you'll feel disappointed at all those years where you could have done something different in the world outside.The film is also an eye-opener. You open your eyes to what its like in prison; although, the prison in the movie seems more ideal than real life prisons. You get a glimpse of brutality and rape inside prison. You get to see how some prisoners become institutionalized and never seem to want to leave anymore. There is also a depiction of how rampant corruption is, and its sad to think that those involved are the ones who are supposed to be protecting and abiding by the law.The cast is great. I couldn't ask more from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Even the other prisoners are good too. Overall, I think that the main point of this movie is never to lose hope; that hope is always a good thing. This movie is as equally good as Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction (movies that were made in the same year as this), but I can't understand why only these two movies got most of the attention. All in all, this movie certainly is the kind of movie to watch before you die."
" Excellent Movie
",spoiler,"it's very good film i watched it more than 10 times i like scene of the actress on the wall and the plan to escape i loved the actor personality Morgan was protector to the movie i liked prison manager in acting all actors were perfect i adore adore adore this movie i will watch all movies of this actor thank you a lot but i need to know it;s areal history or not ? as someone told me it's real but i can't believe that cleverness , beverage scene was good when he solved the problem of the officer , i need to see all movies of prisons as prison break but i don't know names as i'm Egyptian can't now more American movies so i need help in that"
" They sure don't make em like this anymore
",,"Not really a lot you can you say about this film that hasn't already been said. One of my all time favourite films. How Morgan Freeman didn't get a best supporting Oscar for this film, I'll never figure out.Wonderful, amazingly written film. The cast are superb (Tim Robins always underrated as an actor). Pulls you through every emotion. If you haven't seen this film then you you don't know what you've been missing. A must have for any movie buff.It didn't do so well at the box office, but this movies reputation has grown over the years through word of mouth, showings on television and then of course along came the video then DVD rentals."
" Morgan Freeman is a man without freedom but gets it in his own little way
",,"Damn son, why is this movie so high in the charts? Isn't it another prison movie?  Oh it is more? The convicts are the good guys and the wardens are the bad guys? Wait a second there champ; isn't that the case for every prison movie there is? What is that? It has Morgan Freeman having lots of cool internal monologues that border the poetic? And speaking of poetic, isn't there a lot of poetic justice in this movie? There is? I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE!OK folks, let's be straight about it. This movie is a teen adventure masked as a gritty drama. The setting is pessimistic as heck and the characters act like they are all boy scouts. If you see the whole thing from a realistic point of view, it is basically making heroes out of criminals and villains out of the system of justice. And it is also about rewarding the heroes and punishing the villains with a cop-out way and heading for poetic justice.Of course the movie was never supposed to be realistic and it is a mistake to go in with a critical mind. It is about a feel-good mentality, to never give up no matter what problems life throws at you. So seriously, don't try to reason that sweet old guy who didn't want to leave prison but the evil warden gave him his freedom and thus ruined his happiness. Neither try to make sense of why the system refuses you parole while you want to and agrees when you give up. Or how someone digs a tunnel for 20 years and an inspection never finds the hole or the soil he was removing. That is not the point anyway. It is about making the best of what you have and defending your ideals with your life. A thing which definitely stands out is that the objective of the film is not for the protagonists to escape. Freedom is not found outside the walls of the prison yard but in the state of your mind. This is what Andy manages to offer to everyone by gradually transforming the gray cells into a place where the inmates can find recreation, hobbies, and even wisdom through a library. They find happiness even when confined. Of course I am too much of a cynical bastard and I couldn't get into the above mood so well. Call it unwillingness to suspend disbelief but when I saw all the things Andy offered to the inmates I was only thinking of how more dangerous they will be if they ever get out, with added wisdom and crafts in their disposal. Because most criminals don't reform in prison as you probably know; they learn new tricks and come out more dangerous than before. Of course the movie was heading for the fluffy feeling of thinking ""Hey, if you give criminals enough hobbies and recreation in prison, and treat them like human being, they will be law- abiding citizens when they return to society"". Sweet thought, but still unrealistic since it mostly takes for them to get a proper job to support a family and stay away from their criminal connections. And yes, I am missing the point but that is how I felt while watching it. Would any of the magic in this film work if we were told that every major convict had killed a dozen people, raped several women, and molested his own kids? Nope, but the past is not the point. It is abut offering redemption to them regardless of what they had done. Giving them a second chance if they deserve it and helping them to get back on their feet after all the beating life gave them. Sweet concept, very nicely presented, but I am still a cynical bastard, so I give it no more than a 7/10."
" Honestly Incredible
",,"This film is brilliant, just brilliant. I watched this film expecting just a normal movie but when it ended I knew it would stay with me forever. Every decade has one or two groundbreaking movies, the 70's had The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, the 80's had Platoon and Raging Bull the 90's had The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction and the 2000's had Gladiator and The Lord Of The Rings. There were a lot of good films in the 90's and this is up there with the best . The story is about a man called Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is wrongly convicted and sent to the Shawshank Prison. When there he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and then the story takes off. The acting is incredible and Freeman and Robbins deliver the performances of their career, the script is incredible (another great collaboration between Steven King and Frank Darabont) and it didn't win one single Oscar! This could have been good enough for three Oscars at the least, true, the competition (Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction) were good films but, The Shawshank was certainly good enough to win a couple.So if you haven't seen The Shawshank Redemption, buy it, rent it and watch one of the most powerful and moving films ever, be prepared to be blown away."
" An all time classic
",,"This has got to be one of my favourite films of all time. I first saw it when it made it to British TV and have only just got round to buying it and i've watched it a few times since then.The characters have so much depth, you end up loving them the more you watch this film. The acting is first class. The cinematography is first class. The sound is first class. The casting is first class. The dialogue is fantastic. All these elements and more make this a riveting watch and you end up wishing the film could be longer.This is one of the few times i've seen a film after reading the book thinking the film is an improvement. It seems to me it expands a little on Stephen King's novella.This film deserves the rating it has here on IMDb"
" Cinema at its best
",,"Shawshank Redemption narrates a beautiful story of two prisoners bonding over the number of years. Their experiences in the prison and the chemistry between two (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) have been shot with terrific care.Editing and Screenplay of this movie are among the best in any movie you will see. The credit goes to director on shaping the movie in such an interesting way and the ending of the movie is arguably among one of the very bests. One might feel the movie is a bit slow at times, but you are always into the plot which brings on new surprises consistently. Overall, this is the sort of movie you will remember for long time and a benchmark among the ""feel good"" movies. MUST WATCH."
" excellent
",,"This is a must watch movie in every once life,love it.. the reviews which are ahead are as good as the movie... every frame in the movie has its meaning. one can think easily that even though movie came on to the screen two decades earlier it is still no:1 in its position i personally created this account to give my rating and write a review on such a wonderful film. i felt very happy after watching this film and i thought of sharing with you. finally i want to say that ""entertainment is there ever corner of our life. but meaning of the true life lies with in this movie"". this movie give a valuable message ""if we want a thing really & actually from the heart then every force on this earth will try to help us..but the only thing we have to do is never loose HOPE"""
" great movie
",,"it is the most great film in the history of American cinema. Robbins and freeman are fantastic. it implants hope in our soul. friendship relation between the Robbins and freeman in the film is very nice. i know that movie is the first in the IMDb schedule , and its really worth it. When I watch any movie I always return to your appreciation of it and relied upon, but in this film I've seen just so, I said it deserved to be the best and when I returned to the evaluation have really found is also.But I do not know why did not achieve high income while movie display, but perhaps it was due to have been introduced in the early nineties of the last century, and the film does not usually attracts young researcher substance or sexual violence."

" ""I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged""
",,"""Every mind has billions of ideas and each one of us do things that no one expects us to do, some of those things are visible, some not but one of those things that make our life worth living is FREEDOM""Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a young man who faces a long, long time in prison after he is wrongfully found guilty of murdering his wife and her lover. While inside he learns an awful lot about what a man can hold onto and let himself be put through if there is still an ounce of hope in his soul. Bottles of cool drink on a hot rooftop, a slowly building library collection, the moment of musical joy that sees Dufresne severely punished for his overstepping of the mark and many other scenes spring to mind as classic moments in a movie almost chock full of classic moments. Andy quickly gets befriended by ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), actually the narrator of the story, both soon prove that even in the worst circumstances, within the ""hell on earth"" they can maintain human dignity and strive on their own way to freedom... Morgan Freeman is the film's secret strength, playing ""the guy who can get it for you"" with a note of welcome ambiguity. Watching him in an early scene, when a fat, new convict (fresh fish) is being beaten by cruel head guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), you don't know whether Red looks so crestfallen for the victim or for the packs of cigarettes he just lost betting the guy wouldn't break before Dufresne James Whitmore was equally memorable as a prisoner who was unable to adjust to the outside after his parole following a 50 year stint. This shows that people who have been incarcerated for such a long period, need some sort of readjustment training before they rejoin society. For Whitmore, freedom meant ultimate doom, making the scene one of my all-time favorite displaying the ultimate dark side and a certain fear in freedom. Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman along with James Whitmore etched unforgettable performances as prisoners charged with crime. The film shows what prison life is all about. Subjects dealing with prison survival, brutality, corruption and ultimate redemption are well shown. An outstanding film dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoners. Many social problems are discussed here. The picture earned a well-deserved best picture Oscar nomination. It certainly should have tied with the winner, the equally good ""Forrest Gump.""My Rating - 10/10"
" This is a superb movie.
",,"The story as a whole is incredibly done, everything from the camera work to the choice of words used. I also love how each character is so unique and well developed. So many small adjustments are made throughout the film, to the characters make up for example, which makes this such a well finished film. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a brilliant film. 10/10. (side note, this is my only 10/10 film)It is an emotional and thrilling film which has many plot twists. I feel like this is one of the greatest movies every made, and i have many good reasons to think this.-Sean"
" Because it's still the Best
",,"Really, after all this time, why write about Shawshank now? Well, simply, it's still the best movie I've ever watched.... 10 times. This is a movie that from start to finish keeps you engaged like no other film. When it concludes you wonder how a 2 hour plus movie can go by so quickly. No bathroom breaks or snack breaks during this movie, whether it's the first time watching it, or your tenth. Just sat down and watched it again 2 nights ago with my daughter (12). She too never moved from the couch and loved the film. This film will hold up to the test of time because it's simple: great writing, great acting, great directing and watchable over and over."
" This is a movie that took my heart away from me.
",spoiler,Yes! it's absolutely true.Recently I had gone to a DVD shop. I found this movie and bought it. SHAWSANK REDEMPTION is a never before never again movie. One man is accused by murder case that he did not do that. after he becomes a prisoner. in that prison another man finds him and they becomes close friends. but that man never loses his hope to be a free man. he makes his all prison life to find a solution to live as free man in the world and he does some things to ensure this to come true. then he finds and makes his life absolutely free. This amazing movie was directed by frank darabont with original story by stepen king. afterwards this movie was nominated for seven Oscars including best picture. but won nothing. I don't hesitate to say it's a evergreen movie all time in everyone's life.
" Remember Hope is a good thing.
",,"Finally I Watched ""Shawshank Redemption."" Well, Last night I watched a movie which has most un-believable rating on world's most trusted movie rating site, IMDb with a rating of 9.3 by more than 800,000 votes (yes!). I's indeed very overwhelmed & enthusiastic about the movie.(you know, that much publicity takes the excitement to the extreme level) Now, talking about the movie, it is a story of a man who gets life imprisonment sentence for a crime which he didn't commit. Here it remembers me about the classical Russian novella named 'The Kreutzer Sonata' by ""Leo Tolstoy"". It seems to me a bit inspired from that. Indeed. The rest of the story line is different. It specifically a story of a man's struggle (in which he got succeed) to come out of the prison (by hook or crook, take it your own way) and proved himself innocent after the hard sufferings of 19 years imprisonment. The whole story tells about the moral to heed i.e. ""Hopes Never Die."" I really can keep this movie on my All-time favorite movies list. It deserves so, Btw. This is some of among those movies in which I didn't check the duration even a single time. And, during the whole movie I was just sitting on the edge of my chair with wide open my eyes & my mind (off course). And, for now, with classiness of this movie in my brains & off course terrible sleep in my eyes, I'm no more in situation to write anything else. But one thing I'd make sure that very soon I'm gonna read 'Stephen King'. And, At the last I'd like to halt my review by one of the dialogues of the movie, Which I liked a lot, ""Get busy living or get busy dying."" And, I'm really nowhere an obtuse to just review it like a blind-head Ass. Lol :) Remember Hope is a good thing."
" The best movie made to date.
",spoiler,"I absolutely love The Shawshank Redemption. When a movie gives me goosebumps, it has done its job. Where to start. The acting in this movie is sublime. I had never seen any movie starring Tim Robbins, but Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors. Tim Robbins portrays an intriguing man. He and Morgan Freeman work together extremely well.The story itself is brilliant. A banker, wrongfully put in prison would not seem that interesting, but with these people and their conversations and companionship it's certainly worth a watch. I was sad when I thought the director killed off Andy Dufresne at the end, but when I realised he had actually escaped I couldn't stop smiling until the movie was over. This movie certainly deserves the #1 spot in the top 250 movies, as it's a must see for everyone."
" The best movie ever
",,"This movie doesn't deserve a 10, it deserves a 11...This is the best movie I ever saw, everything on the movie is great, the story, the acting, the message, just everything. I spoke with so many people that saw this movie, and everyone of them said that The Shawshak Redemption is a truly masterpiece.If someone is reading this- please stop reading and go and watch the movies if you haven't yet, because you will see one of the best movies ever made in human history. It is the best rated movie (9.2) and when I see that rating Im just asking myself ""why is there just a 9.2 instead of a 10??"
" My all time favourite film. Beautiful.
",spoiler,"What can i say, its shaw shank. I don't refer the film as the shaw shank redemption i call it shaw shank as everyone knows what I'm on about when i say its my favourite (and i only seen it in April 2012). The story is well known as Andy dufrense is wrongly accused of a double murder and sentenced to shaw shank prison where he meets red (played by the awesome Morgan freeman). Over time in the movie he adapts to life in prison and escapes and becomes a free man. How did a movie this so simple become beloved by so many. How? I don't know how and i don't care but this film is basically a beginner for any filmmaker and already became a success years later. Although it did not great at the box office yet critics praised it well, years later people discovered it on VHS. I wished i seen this film earlier as a teenager as it would have struck to me even more through a time i felt depressed and sad. A discovered this movie in the local library and rented it as i heard of the film being very good and after seeing it, it is more than just good. I may be over-exaggerating this brilliance of the film but it unlike many other films (except the lion king of the return of the king hit me right in the soft spot). I didn't cry at the end, i smiled at the end. What a film.The good of the film, the acting from freeman. Although he lost to hanks in Forrest gump for best actor, i don;t care as hanks did as much as a good job as freeman did (if better). Tim Robbins was also amazing and likable with the supporting cast doing perfection to the highest level. The score is beautiful, the mies en scene, the scripting writing is gold and genius making this a classic. This film is not complex and it is something that makes it just so darn good. The pacing is perfect and the narration from freeman is timeless. The iconic shots of Andy raising is hands in the air after escape is timeless as and should be attempted when finishing school (as i have did).A film highly recommend by me and others as well, touched me to the point of joy and laughter and will bloom your day as it always will live as cinemas most beloved classic ever. 5/5"
" One of the greatest films ever made.
",,"Whenever I see a prison or even think about it, the first thing that comes to my mind is this film. Maybe it's because I have watched this masterpiece so many times that it's actually made a place inside my head and will never go away. I just cannot explain how well this film is made. The direction and screenplay by Frank Darabont and the fact that it is based upon ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King makes it highly likable. Moving on to the performances by Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, they shine just like a diamond, stupendous performances by them. I still can't believe that it never got any major accolade and didn't even make much money but still it has developed into something sensational which can't be missed."
" Great among greats.
",,"I have three framed posters of my favourite films on my wall. On the left is 'The Dark Knight' and on the right is 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'. These are the best films of their outstanding trilogies and, in my opinion, are the greatest films of my generation. I have watched each countless times because they're filled with action, suspense and tension and also incorporate a sense of overcoming that which seems impossible to overcome.Then, purely because it was rated highly, I watch a film not of my generation, on a free DVD from the Sunday Times. Without special effects or a large budget, The Shawshank Redemption became my third poster because it exceeds the qualities TDK and ROTK have in abundance. Each are excellent. Shawshank's better."
" Love this movie!
",,"I'll keep this short and sweet. I am not the type of person who reads critique reviews and determines whether that will make me watch a movie or not. However, I didn't think I would ever want to see this movie after seeing the preview and a friend said it was a bit slow. I have to honestly say that I was impressed by the directing, acting and overall story. This is a great move! You should defiantly take the time out of your life to see a great movie that is not a superhero remake. This story has structure, purpose and meaning. Though, if you can't sit still then don't bother. However, I do think it's time we get some culture back in our lives."
" ""Best of all time""
",,"I can't figure out how a man could think such an outrageous concept like that!Its just beneath all the beautiful thing.Thanks to Frank Drabount,Morgan Freeman,Time Robbins.Excellency is sky high in this film.Not a movie,its just a lifetime experience.Sometimes people felt to sad ,they curse themselves,regret for everything they have done in life.They crush for success,run after money.But,here is the thing that changes everything and it is indeed ""The Hope"".No matter how bad you feel,no matter how hard the path of the life is,the show is still goes on if you have just one thing and that is ""The Hope"".Life would certainly changes if peoples take the deep meaning of this wonderfully executed movie.Probably It will help many people to start their life for the second time!!Hats off to everyone who worked with the Shawshank Redemption Team.."
" This is the film
",spoiler,"What can I add to all the other reviews here? Just my own feelings about this. I now realise I watched the film in one of the hardest times, emotionally, I can remember in my life. Thoughts chasing themselves around in my head, heartbroken, paranoid and not well physically. Total mess.My dear female friend who got me through it all told me this was a film to watch. I initially resisted, thinking it was going to be lightweight, PC fare. I don't know why I thought that.There's a lacklustre opening sequence -I think. Then you get to see what kind of performance Morgan Freeman is going to turn out this time, and you start to be interested. Then this extraordinary scene flying over the prison, and I think by then you're hooked.This scene is deeply moving, not least because of the music. It's difficult to see how Thomas Newman's music for this film could possibly be bettered - perfectly listenable to in it's own right, but when you do you're reminded of the boys on the roof in the sun, enjoying their first beer for so long. They've been touched by Andy's kindness. Sometimes a kindness is thrown back in one's face, but other times a gesture of gratitude is given back - like Haywood getting up and offering Andy one of his beers - and a powerful connection is made. The film is full of great hardships and unbearable sadness - surely scars that can never completely heal or be forgotten. But it is also full of joy and fun and hope. To capture all the above in a film is a triumph. I started watching the film fairly closed to feeling, but as I watched the end I could not contain my tears, unusually.So a moment when a film came along at the right time for me, and no doubt for many others"
" Get up and watch it
",,"""I have been thinking for a while to watch "" Shawshank Redemption""(1993) the number one movie on IMDb list 9.2/10,finally did it, its a excellent example of good story telling ,one of the story that makes u think and touches your soul, this movie is all about hope ,hope in bad times & not letting it go whatever is the situation ,hope that one day u will have your laugh,hope to be loved again,hope to achieve something big,hope to breath free. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins)not only was hopeful for himself in the his bad time but made his prison mates hopeful by providing them feel of freedom through books and music,he also gave his best prison mate Red (Morgan Freeman) reason to live once he made it out from the prison. and as Tim Robbins says ""hope is one of the good things and good things never dies""."
" No good thing ever dies.
",,"The greatness of this film is in its excellent presentation and articulation of what lies deep within a human being that makes him/her persevere against impossible odds, especially so when he/she is facing a terrible injustice. This reminds me of Viktor Frankl's book 'Man's Search for Meaning' based on his experiences in prison under far worse conditions than depicted in this film. It is only under the harshest and most extreme of circumstances that a sensitive and just human being whose integrity is under attack will almost certainly face the question of the meaning of his/her life and in general the meaning of life and the meaning of freedom. The only real freedom that human beings have lies in a creative response to the impossible but challenging circumstances that one faces, and in that creative expression one finds meaning. No one can give that freedom and no one can take away that freedom – its source is within, and completely independent of external circumstances and institutions. All institutions tend to inhibit this freedom and instead 'confine' individuals so that they become 'institutionalized'. The prison is the toughest of all institutions. But the tougher the conditions, the greater is the challenge and if understood that way, the greater the rewards in finding meaning. But until that is accomplished, one must have something essential and substantial to believe in – call it hope or faith or self esteem – in order to survive, for nothing is accomplished in death. At the same time, the idea of death itself is the motivating force – a sense that one could die without having achieved anything in life is the most powerful life sustaining force itself – this is the most stupendous paradox of human existence, something that was hinted at in Joseph Heller's Catch 22. At the centre of this catch is the hope (a word much abused) that one will find meaning even in the most hopeless of conditions, that one will be able to forge something good out of the entire BS that surrounds us. And that which is good lasts forever. That is the true faith, not the false faith of the corrupt Warden, who in this case is not only the proverbial 'devil who is fond of quoting from the scriptures' but also gives the airs and appearances of one who is a 'man of God' only because of his fanatical devotion to the Bible. The irony of it all is brought out superbly near the end. The ending was the best part in a way because this story was no hopelessly fated 'Greek Tragedy', as the central message of the film was that hope within one man can light up the hope in another who otherwise would have given up, and that this evocation is a very powerful bond between humans, in this case between two very different kind of humans, both by background as well as race, but who become the best of friends because they share something vital deep inside that makes them 'to get busy living' rather than to 'get busy dying'. Finally, what makes this one of the greatest movies is that it also has drama, adventure and action which makes it appealing to a wide audience. For the serious, it can revisited several times for the special kind of mood that it evokes – a mood that is both uplifting as well as thought provoking."
" Brilliant. Shakes you to the core.
",,"Best movie I ever saw. It's a pinnacle in humankind's endeavor in film making and unbelievably without any special effects or fanfare. It's a story about normal human beings. Direction, screenplay and acting all are mind-boggling. Equally mind-boggling is how can this movie not get an Oscar even after considering that jury at Academy awards makes huge mistakes sometimes(remember ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon""). In my mind I've no doubt that even if ""Avatar"", ""Titanic"", ""Return of the King"" and ""Ben Hur"" were all released in same year as this movie, the Oscars for best film, best direction, best actor and best supporting actor should all go to this movie. I've become a huge fan of Tim Robbins (he is brilliant in ""The Mystic River"" too) and Morgan Freeman. Also, let's not classify it as a prison movie since it's in a class of its own. It exhausts all superlatives. If you haven't watched it, watch it now. Who knows the world may end tomorrow :-)."
" A Truly Amazing Experience
",,"This title has to be one of the greatest films ever made. It is a touching story of a man who is sent to prison for life for the accused murdering of his wife and her lover. The story is so captivating and completely differs from other prison films because of its heart.A defiant masterpiece which makes you enthralled within it from the very beginning. Brilliantly acted by Tim Robbins and, of course, Morgan Freeman as always. Brilliantly directed, scripted and the original score was very, very good.I have watched it three times in the last year and I still can't get enough of it. A defiant worth wile watch."
" Absolutely Amazing!!!!
",,"Decided to check out IMDb topper as a time pass and was i glad i did.One watch and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has been added to my all time top movies...The golden year of '94 which gave the world some of the best films of all time didn't disappoint with this one...The cast was superb...Tim Robbins is amazing and Morgan freeman again shows why he is at the top.The bond between the main characters is well developed and the climax is mind blowing.The movie gives genuine inspiration and is more than suitable for repeated viewing when one feels down.I give it full 10/10 as it gives u more than a regular film does.It shows the importance of hope in life and why one should never loose it.The Tagline tells it all - ""FEAR CAN HOLD YOU PRISONER,HOPE CAN SET YOU FREE""..."
" Awesome
",,"Awesome movie, Based on the Stephen King novel, Shawshank Redemption is a delight from first scene to last. The opening is a brilliantly done sequence with Andy's (Tim Robbins) trial inter cut with his actions on the night of his crime.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of double murder who is sent to jail, eventually befriending other lifers including Morgan Freeman's Ellis Redding. Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" (in the film version, it's really Raquel Welch, not Rita, who aids in the ultimate twist). On the surface, it's another prison-genre picture with the usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden, a cruel guard, a few homosexuals, and a quirky old-timer who doesn't want his parole. However, the film's emotions run surprisingly deep, justice is well served by the conclusion, and several of the cast members carve out amazing, three- dimensional characterizations."
" A film you won't forget.
",,"I'll always remember watching this film when i was younger, it was one of the first films that ever gave me that 'mind-blowing' experience you sometimes get when you've seen a brilliant movie. Tim Robbins gives what is undoubtedly for me his best performance as Andy, who is such an inspiring character that you find yourself truly rooting for even in the early stages of the film. Morgan Freeman gave a stellar performance, arguably his best also, as Red, Andy's cell mate another character you grow to love during this wonderful piece of cinema. This is a film i will never tire of, if you haven't watched it for whatever reason, you should do! A solid 10/10 for me! enjoy."
" A Shining Piece Of Cinematic Excellence
",,"This movie was released when I was all of 9 years old. Lucky for me, I didn't come across it until nearly 13 years after the fact. I have always been a movie buff and, aside from that, a big fan of the writings of Stephen King. I had read the short story the film is based on and it led me to this film, which I was certainly aware of prior but never checked out. Afterwards, I had a new list of benchmarks for certain aspects of cinema.First and foremost was the story itself. The writing of this tale, in screenplay form, is absolutely brilliant. The story is fleshed out without lingering in certain areas it would have been easy to linger in, and the pacing of the film is steady and constantly building emotional atmosphere. From the early feelings of confusion and bitter justice (as our main character is judged by his peers) to the dawning realization of what Shawshank Penitentiary has to offer for it's masses of convicted felons. It all flows fabulously, as the tale unwinds from the darkest despair of prison life into the slowly building and palpable hope Andy and Red seem to cultivate for the rest of the prisoners. It's this humanity in the face of inhumane conditions that is at the forefront of The Shawshank Redemption's impact.Second, but just as vital, was the casting. Tim Robbins has always been, in my mind, a criminally underrated acting talent. He always seems to carry a sense of outward vulnerability that belies an inner strength, and in that conflict one always questions his motivation, his reason for doing things. His skill set was married perfectly to the character of Andy Dufrense, who instantly seems in mortal danger within the walls of Shawshank but eventually rises above the concrete and steel. Indeed, it's safe to say that, mentally at least, Andy spent very little time in that prison.Morgan Freeman played the role of Red Redding in a manner that, I think, no other actor could have done. He was not only a veteran of Shawshank, he radiated a sense of calm wisdom and strong sense of brotherhood amongst his fellow inmates that lend themselves very well to Freeman's on-stage abilities. As a ""man who can get things"", Red is instrumental in many inmates' lives in Shawshank. Offering a variety of contraband items in return for the typical currency of incarcerated peoples (cigarettes, petty cash), Red is as important a character as Andy in terms of the film's overall message of hope despite hopelessness. And Morgan Freeman was the best man for that job.The excellent acting doesn't end there. Bob Gunton, who seems to find a niche in playing white-collar criminal types, portrays the warden of Shawshank as a sinister, scheming man who hides his darker desires behind the Bible and an arrogant, holier-than-thou attitude. William Sadler is another outstanding character actor, similar to Gunton, whose face is more popular than his name and who does a fine job as Heywood. One of the more important supporting roles was that of the hard right hand of the warden, Guard Officer Hadley, who was portrayed by Clancy Brown, well known for his bad-ass-type roles. His no-nonsense, hard-edged persona fits well and leaves you hating his character but appreciating his ability to make you hate someone who doesn't exist.Beyond the writing and the acting, this movie was perfect in every other aspect. I've seen it many times over the years, often turning to it, perhaps subconsciously, during particularly rough or depressing patches. I've very rarely come across a film that not only meets my expectations, but exceeds them in a way that leaves me constantly comparing future films to it. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those films, where the outstanding story and the remarkable talents of everyone involved combine to bring vivid fiction to life. A masterpiece of modern film-making that has lost none of it's impact or relativity nearly 20 years later."
" You'll laugh, you'll cry
",,"What is there to say about this movie, except it is a triumph in film making. First of all anything narrated by Morgan Freeman you know is going to be a great movie. A story of a life behind bars with no end, this ordinary man turns Shawshank prison up side down. I think the fact that this movie is so simple is also the reason it is so great. There is no complicated cinematic techniques or special effects, just men talking to each other. Tim Robbins shows us that the good guys can win even when their livelihood has been taken away. Its the kind of movie that just makes you smile on the inside and lets you appreciate the simple things even if just for that day. The Shawshank Redemption is definitely a movie everyone should see, only if just to brighten your day. But I think in the future it will prove to be an important mark in cinematic history."
" Excellent cast and story Line
",,"I saw this movie for the first time 8 years ago. I just happened to see it by chance on cable because I never heard about ""The Shawshank Redemption"" before. After watching the movie I was immensely impressed and positively surprised. Definitely this is the best movie I've ever seen. The story, the direction and the cast (Specially Tim, Morgan and Gil Bellows) are perfect! The Shawshank Redemption really deserves that spot in the rankings. This movie is a ""must see""! The movie not only offers a great viewing experience but also a lesson to take home. Wish more movies are made in this fashion instead of the blood and gore that people seem to appreciate nowadays.Thanks for reading this review."
" Shawshank Redemption Review
",,"Shawshank redemption is probably one of the greatest movies out there hands down. Its a story about a banker named Andy Dufresne who is sentenced to life in prison for killing his wife and her secret lover.At first for Andy it seems that life has taken a toll for the worst while he goes through the first initial weeks in Shawshank.Fortunately he befriends a group of the inmates over the course of his time there. Mainly a character named Red who has some push on things that go down in the prison. Red and Andy learn a lot of lessons from each other and become really great friends over their course of time at Shawshank. The dialogue in this movie is not only enticing, but also has a bit of comic relief here and there. To me this movie mainly revolves not only the character development of Andy as a man sent to jail for life, but mainly about the human condition and what it is like to no longer be a free man. Andy's' most important lesson that he learns in Shawshank is that while they can take virtually everything away from you including your pride and your dignity, they can never take your Hope."
" A Fountain of Hope
",,"If you want to see hope in its most poetic and dramatic sense, choose The Shawshank Redemption. I commend it to everyone who thinks movies are more than source of 'entertainment',that they are mirrors of life and its moral lessons. I cannot find any other movie with such compelling touch of hope, faith and love. You will understand what redemption is, you will understand what a Fountain of Hope can do, if we let it reign inside of us.From the production, to the timing, to the script, and the acting of each character, The Shawshank Redemption gave justice to its box-office title. It may have not won Best Picture but for me, it is the Best Picture by far."
" Plainly Superb!
",,"Let me start out by saying that this is one of my personal all time favorites and as such I may be a bit bias whole reviewing it. On the other hand, there's a reason it's a personal favorite. The movie revolves around the wrongly imprisonment of Andy Dufrane (played by Tim Robbins) for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's life in prison, relationships with other inmates (particularly with ""Red"" played perfectly by Morgan Freeman) and passion for life and freedom. I recently had an argument with one of them regarding this movie. He claimed it was ""too plain"" to be considered so great; my view was (and is) that it maybe be plain, but it's superb. The movie touched me when I saw it, Brooks' long life in prison (amazing acting by James Whitmore), Red's pragmatic persona and Andy's unyielding will and hope, all combines to an amazing movie.In my opinion this isn't some regular ""feel good movie"", it's much more. It may be plain as my friend said, low on visual effects or outstanding camera work – but it's plainly superb. The texts send shivers down your spine, Frank Darabont's screenplay adaption to Stephan King's short story are brilliantly executed by the amazing cast and in the end that's what really matters.I was moved when the movie ended, viewed it and prison differently, I expect it'll remain as a cult favorite despite the ""no impressive effects and mediocre camera work"" as my friend put it.Go watch it if you haven't already, it's in my opinion one of the best movies of all time."
" A Truly Timeless Classic
",spoiler,"94 was such a great year for movies, we had cult classic's like Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction & Speed, But I always thought out of all those.. Shawshank was a movie which didn't get the recognition it deserved from critics and viewers alike. Call me a snob I don't think you cannot call yourself a movie buff, unless you've seen this movie.The plot revolves around an innocent banker sent to prison charged of murder of his wife and befriends an old friendly character portrayed perfectly by Morgan Freeman. Andy Dufriene is a eccentric prisoner and when you live his life (visually of cource) it defines what solace really is. Happiness and sorrow.This movie is definitely worth a buy without question, so do yourself a favour and purchase it ASAP!"
" Brilliant!!!
",spoiler,"Plot: Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker, convicted of a murder he did not commit and sent to Shawshank prison. After two months of being there, he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) 'a man who knows how to get things'. The warden (Bob Gunton) uses Andy's banking skills for his scams and turns out to be more ruthless than he thought. Andy spends twenty years in prison before his legendary escape.This is said to be the best film ever made. I can see why. It is defiantly my favourite film of all time. Some say it is too over rated and that might be true but there's no doubt it is a fantastic and well executed film. The acting is good. Morgan Freeman is an excellent narrator. William Sadler is also good. You can't help but laugh with Haywood.The Shawshank Redemption is a brilliant story of, hope, friendship and obviously redemption. It also has a way of connecting with the viewer's experiences. People relate their own life to the film and it helps people deal with bad moments it their lives. This is not a film to miss."
" timeless and classic
",spoiler,"I avoided seeing this film for years because I thought it was a grim prison uprising tale from Stephen King. Well, I was one third right, it is set in a prison but it is a very good story about friendship, honesty, forgiveness/redemption, patience and loyalty. I'm going to really try and not give away too much of the film because if you haven't seen it yet, you are missing out on a great story. It's set in a prison in the late 40's. Some of the inmates have been there since the early part of the 20th century and with repeated parole denials and no rehabilitation in sight, many have been institutionalized and have lost hope and even lost sight of their own identity. When one such inmate is released, he walks into a world that he barely recognizes. He tries but in the end, fails to make it in the real world and succumbs to desperation and hopelessness. We see some of the guards greedily taking part in violence that is so vicious that it is difficult to discern the prisoners from the prison staff. But, ultimately it is a tale of redemption and the story unfolds with hardship, humor and grace. This is a film that I will see again and again."
" film
",,"what a narration..???,One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair."
" fantastical!
",,"this film is simply brilliant. the characters are all totally awesome and so are the actors who play them! also when watching this amazing film, you don't think to pick up on the little things until it all becomes clear! it truly is one of the best films that i have ever seen along side requiem for a dream and the lord of the rings trilogy. it is that good that when watching it, you forget that it is a film because you get so into the story and so in love with all of the characters. the men/women who wrote the script for this outstanding movie sensation is exceeding talented, as are all of the people involved in this production and they should all be proud of themselves for producing one of the top three greatest films of all time."
" Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies...a fine piece of art....
",,"I Watched the movie 16 years after its release. I must admit that i watched it out Of curiosity for its being on the top of the IMDb list. I wasn't disappointed. Rather felt a sense of victory. It doesn't have any action sequences or any romance or Anything of the sort. But it is one of those films that makes you feel Happy inside and yet sad that you may live many more years and watch Tons of movies but never feel the same climax or emotion that you get Out of this movie. This movie had the most powerful cast and amazing script, and all based on an awesome prison drama novel by horror-master Stephen King!Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary in 1947 for the cold-blooded murder of his wife and her lover. Over the next 19 years, he does what he can to stay above the mire, consisting not only of the cruelty of his fellow inmates but the heavy hand of a brutal warden, Norton (Bob Gunton), a sadist who thumps his Bible while telling his charges that ""salvation lies within."" Andy's stubborn refusal to give up hope in the face of his incarceration engenders the wonder and friendship of several inmates, especially ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who nevertheless wonders about Andy's state of mind.Robbins depicts Andy Dufresne to be a reserved, humble protagonist. It is well-known that other actors were considered to play this role, such as Tom Hanks, but I believe Robbins's presence works wonders for the storyline, allowing Andy to have a quiet temperament that lets him seem at peace with himself. He has nothing on his resume close to his performance here. Freeman puts on arguably the greatest performance of his lifetime in this movie. His narration lets the viewer connect even further with all the characters, and has a poignance that stays with you long after the credits roll. His ""rehabilitated"" speech ranks right up there as one of the all-time great movie moments.Character development is greatly utilized here. Pop culture references (Rita Hayworth, Hank Williams, John F. Kennedy) help give one the impression of the passage of years, and Andy's brave, witty exploits make him a likable hero. Violence and death are also put to use, with several characters dying within the story. We are made to embrace these seemingly real individuals during their airtime, and are hence moved by their tragic deaths. The failures of these characters make the final scenes of the film all the sweeter.Another standout feature of The Shawshank Redemption is the music. Oh, the music! Thomas Newman's musical score shines brightly and lends another dimension to this heartfelt tale. The triumphant piece heard at the end is one that you've likely heard before — as it has been used in movie trailers all over the world. The fact that The Shawshank Redemption did not win an Oscar for its musical score (or in any category for that matter) is almost incomprehensible. Though in a '94 class along with Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, and The Lion King, I suppose it can be understood.I will note that it is a definite 'must see' for all those who consider themselves ""movie connoisseurs"". There are not too many negatives (if any) that can be said on the film. I will state, however, it's current #1 ranking on the IMDb Top 250 is a little bit high though.I guess I'm a little nit-picky, but my main beef is with the ending. The whole movie is about hope. *SPOILERS ALERT* If you wanted hope, then you should not have ended on a cheesy last scene where the old friends reunite and everything is alright. *SPOILERS END* It was touching, no doubt about it, but then the message of hope is dwarfed by our excitement that the two friends are together again. We leave the movie smiling instead of thinking. What I'm trying to say is that to make the core message stick to the viewers, the movie should have ended the scene before, when Red boards the bus and says, ""I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams I hope."" And as the bus drives away from the camera, the credits roll. But again, that's only an honest opinion.Watch this film alone and with attention and it will really get you involved and thinking and thats the beauty of it. I recommend it to everyone who enjoys watching beautiful cinema. I rate it 9 out of 10.For the end i leave Andy Dufresne's quote ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies"""
" The Shawshank Redemption (1994) - Stephen King Got Me Hooked on this Movie!
",,"Stephen King's powerful prison drama story is brought to life, with Frank Darabont's ""The Shawshank Redemption"". The movie tells the story of Andy Dufresne, portrayed brilliantly by Tim Robbins, who is sent to Shawshank prison, when framed as the murderer of his wife, and her affair lover. During his time in prison, Andy makes an unlikely friendship with smoke dealer ""Red"", portrayed by the astounding Morgan Freeman, who does an excellent job of guiding the movie with his smoothing, and confident narration. Now, the rest of the movie talks about Andy's struggle to try and break free from Shawshank, and the unexpected friendship between two different people. This movie is an astounding masterpiece, that can only be spoken through the words of the mysteriously defying Stephen King. Director Frank Darabont helped bring King's vision to life on the screen, and he performed an excellent job as a director, and a writer. Also, the cast is such a true miracle, that the movie was able to get the finest actors to play the most finest cinematic roles. Tim Robbins is excellent, Morgan Freeman is astounding, Bob Gunton is brilliant, and James Whitmore plays such a dramatic small role as ""Brooks"", the Shawshank librarian. Also, I enjoyed Thomas Newman's breathtaking score, the perfect cinematography, the excellent use of film editing, and the spectacular script. I respected every single moment in this movie, and it had me wanting for more. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of the best movies ever made, and I have never seen a movie with so much heart before, even though of it's slow 142 minute run-time. ""The Shawshank Redemption"", in my review, ""a stunning masterpiece, entertainment at its finest""."
" Number one for a reason
",,"What can be said that already hasn't been. Shawshank Redemption is a spectacular film which focuses on Hope and fear. Morgan Freeman does what he always does, delivers a fine, unforgettable performance. With a voice like that it extremely hard too. As Red, Freeman narrates the tale of how a man wrongly accused of Murder, is sent to life in prison and has nothing but hope to cling on.Stephen King epitomise great storytelling. You don't need twists every scene nor do we need a complex plot that tries to hard to stand out. With colourful characters and fantastic interactions, a story can truly become personal. OK, many here has probably never been sent to prison for something they didn't do but this doesn't stop anyone from imagining the fear and hopelessness that one must go through when stripped from their freedom and rights.There only few films out there that makes the most out off every shot. Shawshank is one of those. There not one wasted second, no scene which could or should of been cut from the final version. Everything is done to perfection. You can feel and sense the delinquency and effort put into the film which luckily for us, makes the viewing that extra special.Pointless it may seem, writing a review for a film which has already been critique to death, but heck, a little more praise won't do any harm. Yes, you will get your snobs who will bang on about how this film doesn't deserve to be number one, but those are the ones who believe a story must be plagued by thought provoking twists. All i have to say is that Shawshank is a heart warming tale that will no doubt leave you in a fuzzy ball of warmth and amazement when the credits begin to roll down on this extraordinary tale"
" Scheme Of Hope
",,"""The Shawshank Redemption"" isn't only a movie these days; it's a statement of purpose for underdogs and anyone who ever felt trapped underfoot by a system they didn't understand. Yet watching the film with that knowledge doesn't obscure the fact it is a highly satisfying emotional thrill ride worth taking again and again.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary in 1947 for the cold-blooded murder of his wife and her lover. Over the next 19 years, he does what he can to stay above the mire, consisting not only of the cruelty of his fellow inmates but the heavy hand of a brutal warden, Norton (Bob Gunton), a sadist who thumps his Bible while telling his charges that ""salvation lies within."" Andy's stubborn refusal to give up hope in the face of his incarceration engenders the wonder and friendship of several inmates, especially ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who nevertheless wonders about Andy's state of mind.""Hope can drive a man insane,"" Red warns Andy. ""It's got no use on the inside."" Andy doesn't agree.It's true what other commenters say: You can't pass two-and-a-half hours much more quickly than by watching this. There's enough cleverness, good humor, and uplift to power five Hollywood blockbusters, and terrific acting from the stars to the day players. Based on the Stephen King novella, ""Rita Hayworth And Shawshank Redemption,"" it's the gold standard of King adaptations thanks to the powerhouse work of writer and first-time director Frank Darabont, who uses Freeman's narration to inject King's voice into the proceedings.Robbins is a great lead, physically towering over the rest of his cast, his quiet authority reminiscent of James Stewart, whose famous film ""Harvey"" Dufresne even references at one key moment. But Freeman is the film's secret strength, playing ""the guy who can get it for you"" with a note of welcome ambiguity. Watching him in an early scene, when a fat, new convict (""fresh fish"") is being beaten by cruel head guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), you don't know whether Red looks so crestfallen for the victim or for the packs of cigarettes he just lost betting the guy wouldn't break before Dufresne.""Shawshank"" is otherwise not ambiguous at all. The bad guys are vile, justice is served up on a heaping platter, and a final scene is too on-the-money for its own good. But the ride getting there is so true and natural, so minutely well calibrated with its lived-in details, that you can't really deny this film's classic status, nor want to. It's a deserving King Of The Hill for the IMDb 250.But why is it so highly regarded beyond that, as a film whose message touches so many so deeply? Like so many others, I think the notion of Shawshank prison as a metaphor for life has much to do with it, the idea that however dark and embroiled in life's miseries we become, its belief that ""a warm place without memory"" is not out of reach pulls us in. You can see a religious message in such a notion if you are so inclined, and many are, yet the film is clever enough to work on other levels, too.Finally, it's a great story, well told. People will always have a need for such stories, especially when the things they tell us are as fine and noble as they are here. Andy wants out of ""Shawshank"" bad, but for viewers it turns out being a fine place to serve time in."
" A work of Art and a message of Hope.
",spoiler,"Stephen King is my favourite author and I like most of his books and love some as well. One of the defining features of his books is the characterisation and the atmosphere. No one does it better. This leads to his books being long and slow some times but that's the part of it. This normally doesn't transfer well to cinema where everything is cut and compressed. This movie is better than the book. I read the book and I was impressed I saw the movie and I fell in love with it.The movie focuses on the two main characters and the side stories enhances their character brilliantly. All what comes before ties in to the end. One of the greatest effect in the movie along with the atmosphere is the soundtrack. It plucks at you, it pulls at you and it lulls you in to a world where all that you see flows with it, smiles with it and cries with it.I wont talk about the story since now after so many reviews we are at a stage where we can talk about other features of this movie. There are many great moments in the movie including the two stage ending, both stages immensely enjoyable every time for different reasons. Another great moment for me is the release of Brooks Hatlen from prison. His dialogue delivery (the world went ahead and got itself in to one BIG DAMN hurry) and acting is brilliant at that moment and is perfectly captured further ahead in the movie when Red facing similar circumstances confesses, ""Terrible thing to live in fear"" The same fear can be glimpsed when Red glances fearfully over a stone wall in Buxton to see if he is being pursued or spied upon while he reads a letter. (Great acting and direction) This movie is about hope and friendship. Those of us who have seen it many times, enough to even forget the count are touched by it every time. We now see the movie in its entirety and every magical scene is impressed upon our memory because this is art. The message of eternal hope is wonderfully characterised in Andy and that of friendship in Red."
" A great adaptation of a great book.
",,"I have this film on DVD and it's one of my favourites. That said, it's been several years since I sat down and watched it and I hoped it was still as good as I remembered. It might be worth pointing out here that I've been a huge Stephen King fan since I was at school, probably a good 30 years all told. I have every book in general circulation, and I've read a lot of them more than once. Different Seasons must have been one of the first books of his that I bought when it first came out, way back in '82 or '83. It's a collection of four unrelated novellas, other than that each title has a different season mentioned in the subtitle. The first of the novellas is Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption: Hope Springs Eternal, and it is, in my opinion, by far the best. If you haven't read it, I would thoroughly recommend it, particularly if you haven't seen the film as the movie stuck pretty closely to the original story so there won't be many surprises in store for you otherwise. Incidentally, if you've ever seen Rob Reiner's movie Stand by Me or Bryan Singer's Apt Pupil you'll find two of the other stories in the collection pretty familiar too. But I digress, back to the movie in question.I wasn't disappointed. This is undoubtedly a great movie and thoroughly deserves it's place at the top of the list. The performances from Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman are superb and the friendship between their characters develops over 20 years or so is entirely believable. You see them, particularly Freeman, get gradually broken and institutionalised as the film plays out. And then, of course, you get that fantastic feel- good ending that you really wanted, but somehow never actually expected. But it's not just the performances from Robbins and Freeman that delight. Both Bob Gunton, the sadistic and greedy warden who somehow believes he is doing God's work, and Clancy Brown (remember him as the Kurgan in Highlander?) as the equally sadistic, almost sociopathic Captain Hadley, give wonderfully sinister performances.Most of the other prisoners, with the possible exception of James Whitmore's Brooks, are fairly two-dimensional, but then the director almost seems to gloss over them deliberately to keep the viewer's attention firmly directed towards the two leads and their developing bond.The film begins in the 1940s, and continues on until the 1960s so it was essentially a period piece when it was made. This has stopped it becoming dated in any way. Also, because it's set in a prison which appears almost completely isolated from the outside word, the passage of time is easy to miss. The movie is as engrossing now as it was 15+ years ago when it was first released. At two and quarter hours, it's probably one of the longer films in the list (although by no means the longest), but it keeps the viewer's attention for the full duration, and never seems to lose its sense of direction. Every scene pushes the plot forward in some way.A definite 10/10 from me, and thoroughly recommended."
" If you haven't seen this movie, stop everything and watch it right now
",,"Movies simply do not get better than this.Inspiring, captivating, intense, funny (at times), tragic (at times). Interesting and thrilling.Every aspect of this movie is perfection: the acting, story, dialog, production, setting, cinematography, etc... all perfect.This film is truly flawless.I could not describe this movie as ""fun"" but I would describe it is unparalleled in its excellence- and not in some stupid artsy sense- just plain and simple it is story telling at its finest.If you haven't seen this movie, you absolutely need to watch it right now. Fantastic. I wish I could give it a higher rating than 10 out of 10 stars."
" A Cracking Film That Every One Should Own
",spoiler,"The first time I watched this film I was on a coach heading to the french Alps in year 8 of school. I loved it from the first moment. A few weeks later when I discovered the title of the film I went out and brought it, (or more correctly had it brought as I wasn't old enough). It remains one of my favourite films in my collection.Why do I think this is one of the best films ever, it comes down to the telling of a great story, in a great way, by great actors. From the moment the film begins your sucked in, the audience is made to connect with the events we see on screen thanks to the soulful voice of the great Morgan Freeman, he has the ability to help us relate with events and almost forget we are watching a film, but instead listening to a story from a much loved grandparent. When he speaks the audience definitely listens.However Morgan is by no means the star. The less well known but equally talented Tim Robbins, his performance of Andy Dufresne, is in my opinion one of the all time greats. The way in which the character attempts to retain dignity and his humanity, instead of being twisted into the archetypal convict is reason enough for this film to be in the IMDb top 250. The way at which Dufresne strives to improve his and the other convicts leaves you with a taste on the honourably of the character, or his rebellious acts toward the Warden just to provide the inmates with a piece of music is a scene which you remember just because of its shear brilliance. Which reminds me big thanks to Steven King for writing the book this film was based on, you did good, like you normally do.No one could review this film without mentioning James Whiymore who plays the tragic figure of Brookes, the old lovable inmate. The sad tale of the man who had spent his life in prison and dies in freedom is the emotional heart of the film, I feel sad every time I watch it. James Whitmore was truly a great actor, this film proves it. Th story never gets tedious no matter how many time you watch it, and if its your first time watching be set for a treat.The best thing I can say about this film is watch it, and the only problem you'll have is trying to get across to your friends exactly why the need to see this great piece of cinema"
" Just to add another...
",,"..voice of total respect for this movie.Everything is absolutely fantastic in this master piece. Casting, acting, photography, music, sounds, feel, atmosphere, screenplay, all that is beyond good, it is perfect. Whole movie is immersed in such a delight it really helps if you are feeling down to lift you up. And that is what movies should be all about. Not about damn effects and 3d. As many said before it really lift your spirits up. It gives such a profound feel of hope and happiness, and beyond. And there is another great value of this movie. It proves that sometimes in this lifetime Hollywood is capable to create master piece. It is one but that one speaks for thousands of those we do not get to see. No effects, no damn computer graphics, no faster then light action scenes, and yet after watching it you feel million times better than any other movie.It deserves 11 stars."
" A movie beyond words,loved it !!
",,"This is my 1st review on IMDb , i don't like writing reviews for a movie after all it's just a movie.....you see a movie and you forget... 95% of the movies you see and you forget soon, well this movie really moves you and some of it remains with you ....gives you a great deal of idea how the real world is... each time you see it you feel light and get a feeling of satisfaction .... and more over if you like Morgan free-man you'll love of him after this one.... GREAT MOVIE... used to wonder why is it so highly rated.... well after seeing it.... i don't want to let the rating fall so i added mine and given it what it deserves...and i hope it remains at the top... i would like to thank the film maker and the production as a fan for a wonderful experience i got after seeing this movie :)"
" Masterpiece
",,"You know it's really not the most entertaining movie ever made. you might look around the theater and see people yawning or even sleeping i guess it's not avatar where you get CGI things or these 3D animation movie they make these days nor any batman or superman thing to thrill you with the action. What makes this motion picture special is that you will grow to love this movie , the first time you walk out of threatre you may not think of it as the greatest movie ever made , but there's something about it which makes you see it again and again and each time you see it you learn something new from it. you may be impressed by these great budget movie they make these days but you surely wont watch it a hundred times literally. Count my words you will watch this movie that many times. It's a story about hope as many people have already said in the review also about friendship and almost all these great human emotions. Great great soundtrack by thomas newton is like a cherry on the cake.The movie is so realistic and so much real at places it actually makes you angry, yet it's not a depressing movie like schindler's list or a fairy tale one like forrest gump , it's just a story which gives you hope and strength to face life and value it. believe me lol i have watched a lot of movies and this IS THE BEST ONE."
" Resilience prevails.
",,"Off the hop, I don't mean to upset people with a 9 out of 10 rating. In my world, nobody gets a 10; there is always room for improvement. Mind you, this movie comes very very close to a 10.I knew nothing of the movie before watching it and was picking my jaw up off the floor upon completion. The amount of situations and experiences I could relate to and empathize with was incredible. The simplicity of the message within the complication of human interaction and misunderstanding. It was a shocker. The extent of rawness people can portray towards each other versus the compassion was wound together like yin and yang. We can't really have one without the other.Since, I have seen this movie several times. Each time, I still find something new to ponder if it was intentionally placed, or just happens to fit.I highly recommend this movie to believe in the power of the human spirit and magnitude of motivation brought on by friends."
" My favorite movie.
",,"In 1995, when I was fourteen, out of the blue, I saw in a newspaper, that one of my favorite Stephen King stories, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, had finally made its way to the silver screen.It wasn't showing at the Hoyts/Greater Union cinemas, rather a local independent/art-house cinema. Of course, that didn't bother me so I went. Over 2hours long, Shawshank swept you into another world. Stephen King's short-novel was very faithfully adapted. Three pieces of brilliance stood out then, and still do today. 1 First, the film was brilliantly paced, never a dull moment. Having read the short-novel before hand didn't diminish any expectations. 2 Second a brilliant cast. Sheer brilliance from Morgan Freeman, and Tim Robbins, as Red and Andy Dufresne. Very strong supporting cast in Bob Gunton - the cruel Warden Sam Norton, other inmates: Gill Bellows as young Tommy Williams, James Whitmore, the elderly Brooks (brilliant expansion of character, that short novel only dealt with in two paragraphs). Yet the show was stolen by Clancy Brown. Brown's legendary performance as Captain Bryon Hadley, one guy you clearly didn't want on your case! 3 Finally what remains in my mind the most, from Red's last parole-hearing, to the end of the film. Words can't simply convey the emotions, this was what I didn't except. It was so powerfully done. My favorite quote: Andy Dufresne: ""Get busy living, or get busy dying. "" Enough said."
" Inspiration can come where you least expect it
",,"You go into a film hoping to be entertained. That's the least you can expect. If a film manages not only to entertain but also to inspire then you've really got something. Such is the case with The Shawshank Redemption. Few movies are as inspiring and uplifting as this tale of...an innocent man rotting away in prison? Well that doesn't sound particularly inspiring. Sounds depressing even. But this movie will surprise you. At times along the way it is rather bleak, things seem hopeless. But the movie's hero never gives up hope. He is not content to sit in prison and rot. Get busy living or get busy dying. Is there ever really any doubt which of those options Andy Dufresne will choose?In 1947 Andy, a banker on the outside, is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary for life after being wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He befriends a prisoner named Red, a man popular amongst his fellow inmates because Red is the man who can get things. Most of the men want the typical prison contraband. Cigarettes are the big item. Andy's different. He wants a tiny little rock hammer to maintain his rock collection. And later he asks for a Rita Hayworth poster. As the years go by Rita becomes Marilyn, Marilyn becomes Raquel. It's as good a way as any to mark the passage of time. Time marches on. The world moves on. But the men of Shawshank are left behind. That would be hard enough to take even if you were stone-cold guilty, a menace to society. For an innocent man like Andy Dufresne? You wonder how he cannot be utterly defeated by life. Yet somehow he maintains a sense of calm and a great inner strength. There's something about this guy.What exactly is it about Andy Dufresne? Hard to say because the story is never really told through his eyes but rather through those of his friend Red. We come to know Andy only to the extent that Red does. And for this story that setup really works. Tim Robbins is excellent in the role of Andy, the film's hero figure, but Morgan Freeman has perhaps the more challenging job in playing Red. Freeman's character serves as the audience's eyes and ears. And he also serves as the movie's voice. Extensive use of voice-over narration in films can be an iffy proposition, often proving more distracting than helpful. But Freeman's voice, Red's voice really, narrates this story beautifully. Playing off one another wonderfully Robbins and Freeman make a terrific team. This is a movie content to let its two main characters just sit around and talk. True, there's not much else to do inside those prison walls. But some of the shared moments between Andy and Red are as poignant as any you'll see in any film and the two actors deserve their due credit for making it so.You wouldn't go so far as to call it slow but the movie certainly proceeds at a deliberate pace. This is a story which takes its time in letting you know where it is ultimately headed. It's essentially Andy's story, as told by Red. But there is room for some other characters to carve out their place as well. Most touching is the story of elderly prisoner Brooks, as played beautifully by James Whitmore. His little story within the story definitely tugs on the heartstrings. Of course for any movie to truly succeed there has to be some conflict and for that we have guard Byron Hadley and warden Samuel Norton. At least Hadley is upfront in his evilness. Norton's one of film history's biggest hypocrites, walking around the prison spouting Bible verses all the while being engaged in all manner of unseemly activities. This is a man who needs a comeuppance. But in the world of Shawshank it is Norton who has all the power. This is a story seemingly destined for a very unhappy ending. The righteous man does not seem at all likely to prevail. But, slowly but surely, the movie continues to build towards something. What that something will be you can't quite be sure. But when the moment comes where all is revealed the film's ultimate triumph is secured. For you have seen not only an entertaining and utterly compelling story. You've seen something which can't help but make you feel better about life in general. This is a movie to see when you need to have a little of your faith in humanity restored. It may not be, as it is in some places proclaimed to be, the best movie ever made. But is an undeniably excellent movie which has rightfully become rather beloved by most everyone who sees it."
" you want a great emotional story, here you got it

Morgan Freeman is great like in all his films, you just can't think of a better casting... i love this filmi'm not quite sure if it deserves to be #1 on the top 250 IMDb list, but well, you decide... hope you love it as much as i do !"
" A Truly Epic Redemotion! Every Prisoner must see
",,"For a long time now I had seen this movie move up the IMDb ladder and make its way to becoming #1, I was a bit irritated being that it took the spot of ""The Godfather"" however, this was before I had ever laid my eyes on even a trailer for this film, so I researched through the credits and found out that it was based on a novel by one of my favorite writers ""Stephen King"", I know what your thinking, how could he be one of my favorite writers if I didn't even have a clue about this Masterpiece. July 24, 2010 was my movie day, I promised myself I was going to stay up 24 Hours watching some of my favorite Films, I started of at around 12:45 with the controversial, sadistic, genius, masterpiece that is ""A Clockwork Orange"", then after my brain was through with Ultra-Violence I proceeded watching the best sequel ever made in the History of cinema ""The Godfather Part II"", then after I felt like a Corleone I started watching the Coen Brothers Masterpiece ""No Country For Old Men"", then after feeling lost I started watching ""Pulp Fiction"" and after that the time was around 4:30 P.M. and I broke my promise to myself and took what I thought was going to be a 2 Hour Nap which turned into a 6 Hour Intermission, I woke up around 10:00 deciding which movie I was going to watch and I wanted it to be a Classic I had never seen, I was thinking ""12 Angry Men"" but for some reason I wanted to see what the all this fuss was about when it came to Shawkshank Redemption"" so I rented it and started watching around 11:45 P.M., Let me just say after this movie left an Impact in my Life and Mind, I now actually know why it is #1 on this site and it is for good reason, this movie made me laugh hysterically at times like in ""Animal House"", it made me think like ""Fight Club"" does at times, it made me frightened like ""The Shining"" at times and I have no other movie to reference my Sobbing emotions with because no other film has made me Cry, and that should tell you that after a day of Great Films this one had the biggest Impact on me."
" Simply the best movie ever made!!
",,"I have seen this movie about 6 times and I get stunned every time. Now has past one year since I last saw her, so it got me thinking; what is so good about this film? is'it the story? the director? the actors? or maybe just all of this things?. I mean what makes this the best movie ever made?? Is'it the feel-good feeling in the end? I don't know a person whose does't feel good after this movie. Tim's and Morgans's performances both deserved Oscar, but I'm not gonna take'it from Tom Hank's that his performance in Forres Gump also deserved Oscar. So if anyone can tell me the ONE thing that make's this the best movie ever made."
" Camaraderie between Robbins & Freeman is too difficult to surpass.
",,"The Shawshank Redemption.The best movie i have seen yet.Its adapted from a novel by Stephen King but this is a special film even better than the novel i suppose.Best adaptation yet to walk through in International Cinema.The great camaraderie between Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman is very difficult to surpass.Wow!!What an on screen display by both of them. If Robbins was fantastic then Morgan was emphatic.Brilliant acting by Tim Robbins.The best by him so far.Even he would admit.Morgan Freeman comes out with an en-lighted performance.His dialogs in the film are truly inspiring & heart aching.Fantastic work by him.An epitome of performance by Morgan Freeman.The rest of the casting is good.James Whitmore as Brooks is a revelation,so is Bob Gunton as the warden.The plot is superb.Ending is classy.You can never make out what happened in the end.Its such a travesty that you have to watch it again.The directorial of Frank Darabont is top stuff whereas the screenplay by him is very much adulated.The dialogs are so memorable you will always carry them along.Here are some of the best dialogs from this:Andy Dufresne: They say it has no memory. That's where I want to live the rest of my life. A warm place with no memory.Red: Let me tell you something my friend. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane. Andy Dufresne: That's the beauty of music. They can't get that from you... Haven't you ever felt that way about music? Red: We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men.This movie is the epitome of all others.No movie can emulate the camaraderie between that of those two Shawshank Prisoners.Must watch for a fabulous & thrilling experience."
" Not so much a movie as a work of art.
",,"Acted out perfectly by every cast member, under the watchful eye of Frank Darabont, the story of a man who brings hope to the grey walls of Shawshank prison becomes so much more than a prison movie. The first time I ever saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"", I knew nothing about it, and was utterly unprepared for it's effect. Within the first ten minutes, I was utterly drawn in, unable to pull my eyes away from the screen. By the end of the first hour, I couldn't even think about pausing or stopping this film. I spent the last fifteen minutes crying my eyes out at the sheer emotion in those minutes. Morgan Freeman out-does his every role previous and every role since as Red, while Tim Robbins, quiet and intense, leads the cast as Andy. This film been regarded for more than fifteen years as one of the greatest to ever emerge from cinema. It is a story of corruption, and of justice. A story of imprisonment and of freedom. A story of despair and of hope. More even, than all of that, ""Shawshank"" is a story of humanity, and one that will stay with whomever watches it for a very, very, long time."
" There's a reason why this didn't win ""Best Picture""
",,"""The Shawshank Redemption"" did not win ""Best Picture"" because it will remain to be an example of how a movie does NOT need to win some sort of ""award"" top be considered one of the most prolific experiences an acting production can make someone go through. This is not just a movie...It's an experience that everyone need to partake in. I have maybe only seen about 450-500 major motion pictures with about 80% of them being produced after 1980, BUT THIS IS THE ONLY MOVIE OUT OF ALL WHERE I ACTUALLY FORGET THESE ARE ACTORS ACTING IN FRONT OF A CAMERA WITH A MOVIE CREW. Do you know what that means? --It means not only Frank Darabont, but every single person involved in this film fused so well that they truly made a piece of artwork that puts people in such an emotional trance they forget whats happening for 2 hours. THIS IS WHAT EVERY DIRECTOR AND PERSON WHO WORKS IN THE FILM BUSINESS DREAMS ABOUT...MAKING A MOVIE THIS GROUNDBREAKING.""The Shawshank Redemption"" will show you how true friendship can arise from anywhere...Even in a prison--where people fear the most to be in. --Maybe it shows the intrinsic drive humans have to create a social bond in any situation.Sometimes when I talk about this movie to people I feel really disturbed when someone has not seen it. I feel like saying ""are you insane?"""
" One of the two greatest movies I have ever seen
",,"I used to like action movies more than anything else. I watched Shawshank Redemption in 2007. When I watched it for the first time I did not know that it is a great movie. When I watched it for the second time I felt that it should be one of the greatest movies. For the first time checked IMDb's top 250 movies and I amazed to see Shawshank Redemption at number two, anyway, it's number one at present.The performances of all the artists are excellent. Not a single character is waste. Especially Tim Robins excels as Andy Dufresne. Narration by Morgan Freeman is sensational. The scenes between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robins are by far the best. The ending is one of best surprises I have seen in movies.This movie should have got the Ascar.I give 10 out of 10 for this phenomenal movie."
" A classic
",spoiler,"Seeing Shawshank as the IMDb #1 did not surprise me a bit. This movie has the heart & soul to be a favourite for a long time to come.I like the reality of the unfairness of the whole situation. There is no glossing over the painful stuff. He was innocent but still jailed. He did get raped. His chance DID get wiped out to have his story confirmed. What a waste.I read some people calling this a 'feel-good' story. Perhaps in the end, but other than the relief of freedom, there wasn't much to feel good about. Talk about a hard-fought battle. And it isn't even over... His life is better than it was, but still sucks considering everything he lost, considering he can never go back, considering he is always a fugitive...If you're feeling bummed out about your own life, this is a good movie to watch to realize that things could always be worse."
" More Popular as Times Passes
",,"In these times, where an ""Every man for himself"" mentality prevails and one's self worth is measured by possessions, this movie reminds us that the escalating fear that we all have, as this country spirals out of control, is best abated by having someone you can call a true friend.As time passes and, more of us see that this country is heading inexorably toward social, political and economic disaster, this movie will find an even larger audience of devotees. Perhaps, one day, we will abandon our materialism and discover that true hope which we will desperately need and, a major theme of this movie, lies in our relationships with others. Until then, we will have the Shawshank Redemption to remind us what real friendship looks like."
" The benchmark of finest film-making
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that will really never ever be forgotten. Arguably the best movie of all time. A thundering reassurance in the hope for a better tomorrow, this movie is truly an epitome of hope and perseverance. Probably should be filed under the category of movies you should watch anyhow before you die. True masterpiece. There won't be another movie that can be quite anything like this.This movie is so powerful that I can't even describe this in a few words. This is the kind of movie that rekindles hopes in all of us. The kind of movie that will always keep moving and impressing generations to come. With a storyline that not only will blow you away, but also strengthen your hopes and faith in the fact that ""Hope is a good thing. Maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies""."
" The greatest movie ever made...
",,"I've read a lot of the comments here. I've never voted for this movie once, but now I'm going to give it what it deserves. And I am going to try to describe why a lot of Shawshank fans are voting this the best movie ever.The reasons that this movie is great are: it has incredible acting, incredible story-telling, incredible pace, incredible writing and dialogue, incredible imagery, and an incredible twist and ending.The Godfather also has these qualities.But the reason Shawshank is better is because it literally is potentially life-changing. People watch Shawshank and someone truly may believe in HOPE. They may truly believe their lives will get better. They may truly believe others' lives can be made better. Its message is not only told, but it is FELT and oft times ABSORBED. For men, for women, for old, for young, for everyone. It is a masterpiece. What other movie affects people in this way? You don't get that with The Godfather. GF is a great film, but you just come out of it saying, ""Wow, that was one of the best films I've ever seen."" With Shawshank, you say more than that. You feel more than that.You will never see another like it. And the mere perfection of this movie, by a novice director, will frustrate experienced and future directors forever."
" American story telling at its best
",,"I'm a big fan of movies that have depth and tells a great story. American movies doesn't always provide that.The Shawshank Redemption, however, is a prime example of what American story telling can be. With a slight non-linear build up, strong and patient character development, the movie drags you more and more into the despair of Andy Dufresne, but always with a sense of hope.For me, there's no two ways about it. This is simply the best movie ever made.10/10."
" Great movie; take time out to watch it and learn some of life's lessons
",,"It took me 10 years to see this movie; I dated a guy who constantly talked about it 7 years ago; but I never did see it. I am not into prison movies; so I kept telling him I didn't want to see it. Whenever it came on television, I would go into another room and watch something else. I just thought he liked it because he has been in prison before; and it reminded him of being in there or something (silly me).But, this Labor Day Weekend (2005); when it came on again; I decided to sit down and just look at it for the first time. Well; was I pleasantly surprised and glad that I did finally see it. Great plot, good direction, characters that had some depth and the surprise ending too boot. Also, just to be able to see Morgan Freeman act is a treat me for anyway; he is such a great actor. He finally won the Academy Award that he so richly deserved all of these years for Million Dollar Baby. He got robbed of the Academy Award for ""Driving Ms. Daisy"" and for ""Lean on Me""; but he finally got what was due him.I also liked Tim Robbins portrayal of his character, as he was quiet, and smart. You know, being quiet sometimes can help a person get through many difficult ordeals in their life. Folks have a tendency to ignore you and don't pay much attention to you then. I learned how to be quiet and not so loud all the time; thinking is better than talking in certain situations.Before I saw this move, I was not being treated well at work by my boss, and struggling with how to handle it. Seeing this movie actually helped me to do something positive about it. My boss and my job will never be the same.Andy was right; we need to get along with the business of living or the business of dying; and living is much better.P.S. I broke up with the guy I was dating 7 years ago; he was a jerk.Sanctified Minister Chicago, IL"
" Sensitive and fascinating
",,"Maybe the best American movie of the 90's. No Oscar for this picture. Maybe too much good to win any prize. Frank Darabont's masterpiece is a perfect example of classical movie: without pretentious direction, without f/x, without a great budget... ""Only"" a wonderful story, a brilliant soundtrack (Thomas Newman already existed before American Beauty), a message about hope, and two monsters of the acting: Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, Red and Andy Dufresne. I didn't think a film based on a Stephen King book could be so fascinating, so sensitive, so wonderful.Enough to stay in your mind forever, and enough to cheer you up whenever you feel down.Rating: 10/10"
" Hope
",spoiler,"When you get two life sentences, maybe you are in total despair especially you are innocent. But the banker Andy was not. He still had a hope for his future. He thought every possible way to get out of the prison. When the hope that recovered his innocence openly broke out, he decided to escape from the prison with his way. He was quite a smart person. Even his friend Red did not know his escape plan. He did it. So Red too. Their reunion at the beach was the warmest scene in the movie.Although the movie got many academy nominees, it got nothing in the end. However it won the heart of people. I think that its positive connotation is enough to move every one. That is why it is still so popular after 11 years. We should not abandon hope at any circumstance. Without hope, without future.Tim Robbins convincingly played the sympathizing banker. His another impressive movie was The player. Morgan Freeman should have won the academy award. If that happened, he did not have to wait 11 years to get the award (best supporting actor for Million dollar baby).A movie can bring you hope. 8/10"
" see it once more
",,"The first time I saw the movie I was crazy about it .I did not want to speak to anyone nor do anything .I wanted to rise my arms and cry ---yes, just like what Andy did .It really inspires me greatly .I believe it is a terrific film because it includes all things a film should have. The plot , the characters,the director,the spirits are all top.So I want to see it for another time .Then I find out that I don't like the oaks which stands for power and strength .Why can't the letter just between two brisks. It's obvious the director wanna tell us something in a obvious way. But it's not serious,this is quite personal. I still know what I can get from this movie. The more I see it ,the more I get .I know Andy deserves the happy ending ,will he succeed in the real world?"
" Deserves 11 out of 10
",,"This was the first movie that I remember as a little kid. When I saw it, i was captivated by the perfect acting of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. I thought all the prisoners were actually prisoners serving life sentences. It was the first Steven King movie I've ever seen, and it gave me the wrong impression about his type of movies.The movie is about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is convicted of murdering his wife and the man she was having an affair with. Andy is sent to jail were he tries to survive a new life behind bars. The movie shows his struggles with the inmates and prison officials. His closest friend being Red (Morgan Freeman) also shares those same struggles as Andy. And the movie has the most powerful ending of any movie I've ever seen.I can say that everyone that has seen this movie truly loves it for every aspect of it. The Acting, directing, and writing, etc."
" The best movie I have ever seen!
",,"The Shawshank redemption is the first Frank Darabont's movie which has taken 7 Oscar-nominations from the Academy but the film not yielded a high profit.Why not? Well,the story of this movie is too good to be true.The Shawshank redemption is based on the book by Stephen King and certainly this is the most brilliant adaptation which has ever based from the writer'novels. The playtime is rather long but seems to be not boring.It's excellently produced,and the acting(Tim Robbins and especially Morgan Freeman)is marvellous.The script is clever enough about the human's relationships and the escape from the prison.The characters and the story itself are clearly true."
" I Never Cried Happy Tears After Watching Movies, Until I Saw The Shawshank Redemption
",,"For quite some time, I've been hearing how good The Shawshank Redemption is. But Unfortunately, I never got the chance to see it. After seeing it last week, I can safely say that the movie lives to the hype, it even exceeds it.The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne ( Tim Robbins ), a hotshot banker who's convicted of murdering his wife and his lover, and who's sent to jail. In the prison, Andy meets Red ( Morgan Freeman ), a "" man who knows how to get things "". And a friendship begins between them.There are many great aspects about the movie. I'll begin with the most obvious one, the uplifting tone. When The Shawshank Redemption ended, I was so happy I cried happy tears, I was never happier after watching a movie.The story of the movie is so simple, yet it's very touching and effective. We spend almost half the movie watching 2 men ( Andy & Red ), talking and walking in the prison yard. Slowly we get to know them better, and in the meantime absolutely fall in love with them. I think friendship was never portrayed better in movies.One of the best things about the movie is the acting. Morgan Freeman was never better in my opinion, Tim Robbins gave a very good performance, but I think he was better in The Player, and the supporting cast ( Bob Gunton, William Sadler, and Gil Bellows ) was pretty good too.Frank Darabont's directing is flawless. He was able to make us believe we're watching a real prison, helped in that by the great cinematography. He excelled in creating the right mood for both the uplifting scenes ( the opera scene, the library scenes ) and the depressing scenes ( the scenes with Brooks, and the rape scene ). It seems Darabont is at his best when he's making movies set in prisons, as evidenced by The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. When he tried to change that in The Majestic, the results were so-so.So, I definitely recommend watching The Shawshank Redemption, if you haven't watched it already. This is truly one of the best movies ever made."
" You can't say enough about the Shawshank Redemption.
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the top 10 American movies ever made. It is written by American's greatest and best selling author Steven King. The acting, directing, etc., in the movie is perfect. Tim Robbins plays the perfect character in the movie and Morgan Freeman gives another stunning performance."
" perfection
",,"This is movie making at it's best. This movie has no flaws. Unlike other movies in it's category this is niether slow moving nor boring. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. It has excellent characters, a moving theme, and subplots that are more intense then some movies alone. Morgan Freeman has the best narration of all narrations. The music is inspiring. I especially like the opening of the movie. Starting with his conviction then going on to Morgan Freemans character, and conecting the two with the line ""when andy dufrain asked me to get him rita haywrith, I said fine."" Then the splendid shot of the prison. (personally my favorite cinematographic achievment ever)"
" Wonderful!
",,"What a complete masterpiece this film is, from the first line spoken to the zoom-out in the end. The actors are all great, but Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins really do outstanding performances. This is probably my all time favorite film and to anyone who hasn't seen it there's only one thing I can say: Please do! You won't be disappointed."
" Deserves all the credit it gets- absolutely AMAZING
",,"Frank Darabont is a genius. In one of the most critically acclaimed, famous movies in Hollywood history, the director from France has created a work of art. Superb performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the film throughout its fairly lengthy duration of 137 minutes smoothly. The film has a very slow pace, but somehow it is incredible absorbing, not boring in the slightest. The story follows Andy Dufresne, (Tim Robbins), a young banker who, despite protesting innocence, is jailed with back to back life sentences for killing his wife and her lover that she ran away with. Once at Shawshank Prison, he developes a friendship with Ellis Boyd Redding- ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman). Red is a man who ""knows how to get things"", i.e  he smuggles things in from the outside world. What unfolds is not what you might expect- it's not the kind of prison film that has a gritty, explicit view of the bad things that happen in prison. Whilst this is shown to a certain extent, its not as bad as it could be and the bad sides generally come from the corrupt screws rather than the cons. This is a moral tale, as suggested by the tagline ""Fear can hold you prisoner....hope can set you free"". It's the kind of film that you can enjoy immensely, watch again and again, and really take a message about life away from. My favourite film, along with Pulp Fiction of the same year, I give it 10/10"
" Freedom and peace
",,"This movie, is more than just a movie, this is about freedom and peace, between each other, many people will learn something watching it, about how the mind could be free when your body is not... That´s all I have to say about the greatest movie of all times thanks if you have read my comments D@ve"
" Narration
",,"What made this movie so great, was not the actors or the story, it was the narration by Morgan Freeman. His way of story telling really brought the story to life, along with great acting and a truly remarkable story by King."
" if only it was true
",,I do not know how many times I thought this film was finished and it was not - although it took a while to get into it the ending was so exceptional I`ve watched it time and time again. There were so many twists I was not expecting - the author should be applauded
" Uplifting and sincere
",,"The key scene in The Shawshank Redemption comes when Red is confronted by Andy Dufresne with the fact that he has given up hope.  ""Hope is a dangerous thing,"" says Red, and we understand, after the trials he has been through, why he can say this and believe it.  And because this is such a well-crafted film, we can also see why Andy refuses to accept this philosophy, because by this time we have come to know them both so well. The movie follows the lives of these two men, who have come to Shawshank Prison at different times in their lives, as very different people. Red has been there long enough, denied parole enough times that he no longer waits for the day he will be released, but for the days he makes his pickup at the laundromat for the goods he sells to the inmates.  Andy was a wealthy banker on the outside, who is sentenced to prison for killing his wife and lover in a nightmarish trial, the kind where every shred of evidence points to culpability.  The movie casts doubt on his guilt long before it reveals what actually happened.  In prison he faces beatings, rape and oppression, but there is some kind of redemption here, too; as the film's title suggests, this is not a joyless foray into prison life but a story about the way two different men cope with the day to day routine of incarceration, and what follows beyond it. What amazed me, watching the movie, is the the filmmakers have pulled of the tricky job of taking this material that could have been cloying and made it plausible, even meaningful.  It is worth seeing just as a statement about how the choices we make in life are more important than what happens to us."
" A very good movie
",,"First time I saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"" was some two years after its release. Second time was yesterday and like every great movie it got even better this time. The movie is a beautiful story about hope that holds you above the surface even when your life seems meaningless. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robins are magnificent, and this film I can recommend to anyone."
" A pure masterpiece
",,"This movie was excellence at it's best.  In my mind, it is great if you can watch a long movie and just not want it to end.  That's what this one did to me.  Besides the point that the acting was some of the best you'll see in the 90's.  The story was golden.  If you haven't seen this, get it now."
" A well-intentioned but unexceptional movie
",,"I came expecting a masterpiece and left with the impression I'd seen a relatively unremarkable film with pretensions of profundity. Put plainly, the primary message is ""Hope sustains the human spirit in a world of hardship and despair,"" which is a truism that would fit nicely in a fortune cookie. Nonetheless, the power of hope can serve as an affecting theme. Perhaps this common theme is taken by so many as great depth because so much of Hollywood's product these days is appallingly shallow or callously brutal. Apparently, the public is desperate for something to care about.The direction is somewhat mannered and reminiscent of older films, which in itself is neither good nor bad. But in this case it blends with a storyline that seems virtually comprised of movie cliches of prison life. The characters are also stereotypes: the evil warden (bible-toting, naturally!), the brutal and inhuman prison guard, the gang of prison buddies, the gang of cell block victimizers, the experienced convict who has mastered the system (played by Morgan Freeman), the enigmatic newcomer who works subtly to subvert the system (played by Tim Robbins) -- all the classics on parade, with few of the unnecessary peculiarities that define real human beings! We've seen them all before, and in more realistic guise. These one-dimensional characters function with the monomania of gears in a machine, churning out a largely predictable plot. This is typical of allegorical stories, and I suspect this story can be read as allegory (which is not surprising, since it is based on a Stephen King tale). Regardless, I can honestly say not one element of the plot caught me by surprise.
In all, the film seems to hover in tone and content somewhere between reality and the idealized world of the fable (say, a fable like The Green Mile, a movie by the same director). Many of the story elements seemed in one way or another contrived, which left me feeling vaguely dissatisfied and manipulated. Even good devices -- such as the well-known tendency of prisoners to become programmed by prison life, resulting in problems when they return to society (a syndrome referred to in the film as becoming ""institutionalized"") -- lose some of their power through a rather heavy-handed treatment. However, the climax of the story (although predictable) was very well-constructed and quite effective.Regarding the acting, Tim Robbins is fair, but hardly awe-inspiring. On the other hand, Morgan Freeman, one of my favorite actors, is a rare talent who is almost certain to turn in a superb performance. This movie is no exception, and I believe if viewers think about it, they will realize that the strongest, most eloquent and moving portion of the movie is the last half hour in which his character, Red, is the focus of attention. The extended denouement almost saved the film for me, but for this viewer the movie reached its end with only a hint of the title's promised redemption.For those of you who want to see a prison movie that is deeper, more profound, has better dialogue, plotting, and symbolism; and presents characters in now familiar roles (your assignment, compare and contrast!) but with considerably more substance and reality, check out Cool Hand Luke. It may not spell out what it's all supposed to mean in Shawshank's user-friendly, large-print narration, but it is nonetheless in all respects the superior movie."
" truly amazing
",,"What can i say?...The only film to make a grown man cry! No film comes close to this in any way or form,it draws you in from the start-keeps you there and if your like me..turns you to tears at the very last scene!.Enjoy it because no film will ever be made like this again."
" Great Movie? nope, there's no truth to it
",,"Many, many people jock this movie, calling it an intelligent, philosophical and moving epic, but It's really not all that.  It is a good movie, but it is not great or thought provoking at all.  That year, 1994, was a great year for movies considering Pulp Fiction, Ed Wood and Quiz Show among others, yet people think Forrest Gump and Shawshank Redemption are great' movies?  Gag me.Here's some of the problems (Don't read this if you haven't seen the movie)Morgan Freeman's character - Don't get me wrong Freeman is a great actor (even if he always plays the same part) but seriously, did you ever watch MTV's Scared Straight' or listened to Chris Rock's stand-up?  Now tell me what kind of 18-year-old murderer goes to prison and kicks around using words that would make Edgar Allen Poe go get his copy of Webster's? Freeman's character's narration also served as a purpose to constantly bludgeon the viewer with 2nd rate philosophy people who've never been to prison come up with.  By the end I was literally exhausted from the constant stream of corny insight I've already heard.  Tell the truth now... If you saw a murderer on the evening news you'd probably want him dead or at least in prison for life, yet here you're supposed to rejoice in his parole as a result of a tired, bitch-em-out-I-don't-care speech that only seems to come up in movies.  Another detraction to the narration is Morgan Freeman dropping the F, it never sounds right.The Warden - How many absolutely despicable characters has that guy played? Has anyone that evil ever run a prison?  That is classic jail movie material.  Obviously the filmmakers realize people will be upset about glorifying criminals so the answer is to make the authority pure evil.  How irritating If you want to convey criminals, just show them having fun and being real people; don't try to cover it up with evil police, try Bonnie and Clyde or Pulp Fiction, much more interesting.Brooks  Some serious button pushing here.  Brooks is a typical, lame attempt to draw out some sentiment.  The bird thing is a rip off of Escape from Alcatraz and like Freeman's character he's a great guy who happened to commit an offense so despicable he's in one of the most secure prisons in the country, but we can forget about that, right?  The `Brooks was here' hanging himself because he can't keep up is another Hollywood favorite.  Who hangs themselves?  My gosh, at Nuremberg guys took poison to avoid being hanged because of the shame and disrespect.  Yet, Brooks hung himself when at his age he could have waited a week and let nature take its course.   Or better yet if Brooks got an old-fashioned whore and binged himself to death on alcohol and mind-altering drugs.   Almost sounds like fun, who would prefer hanging?  You know who, a character in a movie.  That pretty much sums up the Shawshank Redemption, for what its aiming for it misfires because there is nothing genuine or authentic about it."
" Average at best
",,"This is another of those films that inexplicably gets the reputation of being the best film ever made and a kind of rabid mass psychosis by suggestion seems to result. I'm amazed at the number of times this turns up whenever people do a top ten list. Unfailingly, like the proverbial black penny, up it pops. Yawn. I think kids need to be forcefully tied to a chair and made to watch some film history. Why on earth does every single thing Stephen King inflicts on the reading public have to be made into a film? They'll be making his shopping list next. It would be okay if he was an interesting author but the majority of what he turns out is handed down pulp detritus. This film is a staggering three hours long and full of cliched bathetic corn although freeman does his best. Robbins is an average actor and his character is a cypher at best. The plot is very silly. Are they really trying to tell us that no one would check a very prominent item in a cell for fifteen years? There must have been a lot of noise filtering through and a draught which would rattle it like mad. I'm sure that's the first place they'd check behind for a marijuana stash. And didn't prisoners get moved around regularly from cell to cell? The come-uppance of the staff was hugely unlikely too, destroying any poignancy and good will the film may have stirred up earlier. It was daft stuff. And we mustn't forget the old stalwart of hack directing, the thunderstorm to highten...well, I don't know what really, it's hard to see with all that flashing. I suspose it's stirring for some to see a crane shot of a man holding his arms to the heavens. It's a highlight of their lives. I call it film making by numbers. And there are a lot of numbers in this film. It's one virtue is it doesn't duck prison rape."
" Why so high?
",,"This is indeed one of the best prison dramas I've ever seen. I've always been a fan of Tim Robbins and he doesn't let me down here. But I can't believe this is so high in the overall list (I would place it in the 150-200 range myself). Even if we just stick with Tim Robbins, 'The Player', 'Short Cuts' and 'Jacob's Ladder' are all far better films. It was the ending of the film that really disappointed me, but since I'm not allowed to talk about endings in these reviews I can't explain why! Suffice it to say that I can imagine at least two fairly obvious endings that would have been better. Maybe it's the 'American Factor', what with me being English, but the overrating of this film completely baffles me."
" The greatest film in the world (probably).
",,"This film ranks second among my all time favourites. The only reason it does not hold that coveted first place spot is that I am obsessed with Monty Python's ""The Holy Grail"". Shawshank is a beautifully crafted film, with one of the best endings I have ever seen; even though in a way it is not entirely unexpected. It is particularly enlivened by the presence of Morgan Freeman, who should have won an Oscar for his voice-overs alone. In a word, Exceptional."
" An excellent film with some deep thought provoking meanings
",,"Films that invoke volumous comments are either visually sensional, objects of media hype or emotionally stimulating. Shawshank Redemption falls into the latter category. I saw it for the first time on television, it did not need the wide screen or dramatic visual effects because it had been well-adapted from Stephen King's book to portray something that has  worried everyone at some time in their lives.  Being convicted of a crime that they did not commit and locked up for life with the very worst types of human beings.  How being institutionalised is the only way to survive, but when it ends there is no way to go, no way to return to a former life. All human existence is based on a survival instinct. Once that is destroyed, death is a welcome relief.The story hinges around three men,  one who never lost it and escaped to live again, one who nearly lost it but re-gained hope from the first and one who lost it and killed himself. Although the setting was the harsh and hostile environment of prison, it could have been any other institution, a hospital, an old peoples home even a family home.Andy Dufresne is different because he never lost the hope of escape, he used the weaknesses of others, the corruption of prison officials, the internal prison system to help his long term plan.  He had the great advantage over the others, including the Prison staff of being , intellignet knowledgable and clever. Such people always win through.  I did not know what the end was going to be, a clever piece of filming.  Although the meassage was not lost,It should give encouragement to all those who find themselves in a similar position. The justice system, although far from perfect is much improved so miscarriages can now be corrected. But I still wounder what it must feel like to be in the situation of Andy Dufresne but without his abilities.Let's have more such films that provoke the senses and emotions as this one did.  I make no excuse in adding to the hundreds of comments already make on this film , although I have not read them because I wanted mine to be original. But no doubt other thinking people would have made similar comments.  I hope that writers, producers and sponsors read these comments and take note when making more such films"
" Great movie!
",,"This film is amazing! It holds such emotional power. There is such meaning in it, and it is all captured beautifully in this movie. The fact that hope does in fact still exist! Tim Robbins, and Morgan Freeman are an amazing team in it. I loved it! Its one every movie lover, or just anyone should see!"
" Superb
",,"I am not a big fan of Stephen King books. Therefore, it came as a complete surprise that this compelling story was written by the ""King of Horror"" himself. Never has any other movie entertained in so many different ways. It manages to be disturbing and uplifting, both funny and moving. Morgan Freeman is top notch as usual, and Tim Robbins gives his best performance as lead character Andy Dufresne. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favour and buy it from your local video store. You won't regret it."
" Awesome
",,"Stephen King is my favorite writer and I've read all of his books.  When I first learned of them making a movie of ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" I was excited. I'd always liked the story, and thought it would make a great movie.  But I was also apprehensive, because most movies don't do the book they're based on justice, especially when it comes to Steve's books.  But I'm glad to say that I worried about nothing.  Very glad.  The Shawshank Redemption is one of the very best movies from a Stephen King book ever made, and one of my favorite movies of all time.  My score-10."
" snarling critique
",,"awful. a dreadful disgrace. the film is the most cliched in cinematic history and is worthy of no respect. even worse is how it is so flawless yet it still is of no quality. i do not know how this film can be revered over others such as psycho, apocalypse now, raging bull, easy rider, the godfather, the killing fields, some like it hot and casablanca amongst others. shockingly horrendous"
" Sometimes, we all just don't agree.
",,"Last week, I had seen ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" and I feel it is one of the best movies ever made, especially in these hard to entertain folks at the movies for $10 a seat times. I couldn't understand how some, as minority as their voices were, could not like that film.That was until I decided to sit down and write how I feel about this film.
In the 9 years since it has come out, I have attempted to watch it 12 times. Three of those times, I slept through it. I finally took some extra caffine Coke and gave it a twirl -- twice. Sorry, I just didn't warm up to this film. Robbins and Freeman's acting was good, but I guess the story wasn't original -- or surprising to me. I just didn't care about these guys, nor anyone else. It's prison. The guilty as well as the innocent are there -- I get that concept. Sometimes you're released after serving time, sometimes you're not. You make friends...fine. I dunno, kinda reminds me of 4 years of High School or college I guess. I just don't care about those folks no matter what we all did together once I got out, which is why I just didn't care about these and wondered why they should. Move on. Thanks for sharing. Snooze.First I thought, I might not be a big ""prison"" entertainment fan, but then I remembered one of my favorite films is ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" (which I thought much from this film owes homage to), I really fell in love with ""The Green Mile"" (which was more on King's level than this) and I actually sat through a few seasons of HBO's ""Oz"" which was gritty and scary, to say the least. I give everything a chance, in fact -- several chances. But sometimes not all things appeal to all people. For me, this was one of them. (If you're wondering, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is another.)The point is...as I was going to write awful things to those few folks who didn't like ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"", I find myself here at ""The Shawshank Redemption"", and now I am able to stand where they were -- for a moment -- in the minority.All things are not wonderful to all people.And that's....a good thing."
" pleasant trite verging on nauseating
",,"this film is very convincing hokum. nice, gentle, inoffensive and insubstantial story about prison life - I came away feeling prison was a place where nobody says f##k or fears bending over to pick up the soap. check out Freeman, in the token performance of his career, neatly basking in the falsely accused smart white gentleman robbins' shaddow. what a team... so very progressive. 'hope...' . oh yeah, we've got a lot of 'hope' going on here. The lush fantasy kind, so deadly sweet and full of bull. frank darabont is a gifted man who excels in making pretty pictures that strike at the very heart of american pie values and gives them a welcome support by elevating tokenism to its greatest levels in hollywood yet - that is no small achievement, considering... if you don't believe me check out his latest masterpiece, he just can't stop doing it. hell, why not! it sells tickets."
" what is all the fuss about
",,"i had to comment, i really did, all those eulogies on what is in reality a hackneyed complacent pretentious film. Nothing that this film says challenges any principle or thought- its purpose is to confirm every conservative, sentimental, instinct in us all. And yet it has a sense of its own putative profundities, and bulldozes these throughout the film. Really what the film is saying is neither profound nor original, and is not to my mind worth saying in the first place at least not at such length- ie life is hard, people suffer, but through struggle the human spirit will win through, learn to make friends and get their deserved reward - mmm. Nothing makes any of the characters real, and the actors are not helped by this terrible overloaded narration which applies a great weight on the story which cannot breath as every moment is made to seem sooo significant. It is not just that there is no lightness of touch in the direction, or that there is no humour, it is that there is a sense that what is being described is more important than humour, or than the real nature of friendship. Suffice to say i loathe this film and recommend people watch it only as a lesson in what is bad about big budget Hollywood movies."
" The bathos runs thick
",,"For the life of me, I can't understand all the gushing about this cornball, sentimental and PHONY movie.  There are certainly some strong performances, but they're outweighed by some of the two-dimensional portrayals, weak writing (that opera sequence -- oh, please) and most of all a completely garbage ending (I won't give it away) that stomps on what little credibility the movie has.I guess you really can't go broke under-estimating people's intelligence."
" Entertaining but still very much a piece of fiction
",,"Watching this film made me think about the genre of ""prison""-movies and what the theme really is in these stories. All of them seem to have some common elements; the warden is a psychopath, there is almost always some inmate that is out to get the protagonist in some way, there is the companionship and last but not least the portrayal of the human spirit that will not be broken in the direst of circumstances. And maybe that is what ""shawshank"" wants to tell us; that the strong individual can beat an unfair and cruel system by different means. In this story we have Andy Dufresne who is clever but also able to endure visits in ""the hole"" many times without developing psychiatric phenomena. In this sense I will claim that this movie is just as much a piece of fiction as lets say ""starwars"" is. It is simply not possible to stay sane if you are repeatably treated in a degrading manner and if you live in constant fear. The movie is highly entertaining but should not be seen as a serious attempt to explore human reactions in a prison environment where inmates are treated as garbage. Don't fool yourself on this account. Luke Skywalker is just as real as the character of Andy Dufresne is.Regards SimonPs. When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review. If not consider the possibility of a lobbyist. If you agree consider putting this post scriptum at the bottom at your own reviews."
" Totally Unoriginal *spoilers*
",spoiler,"People wonder why I hate this movie so much, and I have to say that its just purely unoriginal.  I mean c'mon... how many times have you heard the story of a guy who's wrongfully accused of a crime and somehow escapes prison using a stupid spoon? If there's one thing I look for in a movie, then it's got to be originality.  I'll let it go if its based on a novel, or a musical, but c'mon... a plot this unoriginal doesn't deserve any credit!"
" An average film that does not bear repeated viewing
",,"Ok, so this isn't exactly a bad film, but it's extremely hard to see why it holds the no.2 position in the top 250 films. The acting is fine, the twist is gratifying (if a little predictable) and some of the shots are fantastic. However, the film is let down by unrealistic dialogue, especially on the part of Freeman's character, who does not seem able to construct a sentence without using a string of metaphors and similes.The prison warder is a one-dimensional villain with very little allure - we, the viewers, are not credited with much intelligence. Because he is a villain, it therefore follows that he must a be a Nazi, no? Cue references to book-burning etc. Furthermore, the portrayal of Tim Robbins' character as Christ is slightly offensive (check out the shot in which he is shown with his arms thrown up to heaven).In true Hollywood style, there seems to be about five 'endings' - when we think that the excitement (or otherwise) is over, another sequence is tagged onto the end. Despite some fairly violent scenes, life inside Shawshank seems actually rather appealing - a library, plenty of time outside the cells. This, combined with the film's massive length, means that for my mind, The Shawshank Redemption merits only a 6/10."
" Why?
",,"I don't understand why this movie is so popular.  Yes, it was an interesting movie, and it was a good movie, but it was not spectacular enough to receive all the praise which it has.  The acting was good, and the plot original, but it was still a rather ordinary movie.  Apparently, I'm the only one with this opinion..."
" My favorite movie was The Godfather until I saw The Shawshank Redemption.
",,"My favorite movie was really The Godfather until I saw The Shawshank Redemption.A lot of people would might disagree with, but I love this movie. the actors are great, the director has done a fantastic job and the screenplay is magnificent.I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.I remember, when i saw the movie I didn't want to get up and go to the toilet. When I finally was done in the bathroom, I couldn't wait to get back and press play on my DVD. At the time I was done with the movie I wanted to see the movie again.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget. So see it, buy it, love it."
" Greatest film of all time after Godfather
",,"This film should be joint along with The Godfather as being the greatest film of all time. The character development and the messages that is conveying is beautifully done. When the messages such as hope, friendship and survival come together, it makes an excellent display.It consisted of different metaphors when they were drinking the liquor on top the roof, and Morgan Freeman was narrating his thoughts as feeling that they were a free man, this was the best moment of the film and made me how at that time people were living in jails.Excellent. Prefect. Outstanding film, best jail film I saw in my entire life...10/10 PS watch out for the new drama that came out in the UK... Prison Break on channel five. If you liked Shawshank then you will like this."
" The number one Stephen king adaption of all time.
",,"Filmmakers that plan to make use of Stephen King's writings in the future need to pull an Orson Welles and watch this about 40 times before they get into it. And read the short story just as many times. This is the best transfer of a Stephen King story I've ever seen. I would give it to Kubrick's The Shining, but it's more like Kubrick took the story idea and did his own movie on it. In other words, while it's a classic, it's not that great of an adaption. Andy Dufresne is wrongly imprisoned for murdering his philanderous wife and while in prison befriends a prisoner named Red, who is great at getting outside products to the inmates. The message of the film is strong and clear : Hope Hope Hope is a beautiful thing. The film is about triumph. About friendship. It's also about some knockout acting. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are at the top of their game. A Must see. Especially if you are a fan of Stephen King's short story."
" a perfect prison drama
",,"The Shawshank Redemption, based on the fantastic Stephen King novel, is a moving story about Andy Dufresne, an innocent man charged with the murder of his wife and her lover who is sentenced to 40 years in prison and fights hard to survive, but in prison he forms a rare and close friendship with fellow inmate Ellis 'Red' Redding. The film more or less focuses on the friendship between Andy and Red, played beautifully by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, Morgan's deep and moving voice was perfect to describe the closeness of his friendship with Andy. The film had a great happy ending where Andy escaped from the prison after serving almost 20 years, he also managed to expose the prison as there was murder and corruption going on there, Andy moves to a beautiful island abroad and when Red is paroled after serving 40 years in prison he is reunited with Andy, it was a great ending to a beautiful movie."
" Move down
",,"There is no reason for this movie to be above Citizen Kane, Godfather 2, etc.  It is a good enjoyable movie yes.  But it is also cheesy at times and a little bit pretentious. I believe what works for this movie is that it has a sort of ""everyman"" charm to it. It is a movie that an entire family can sit and watch and enjoy.  Yet, if one digs deeper into it, those that know movies should be able to see its weaknesses. Its dialogue for one is not very strong.  The performances are solid, but I believe I have seen Morgan Freeman do this role better many times before.  Is this a better prison movie than say... ""Murder in the First""? Probably, but is it sooo much better that this film deserves to be number 2 all time.  THink about that... the second best film EVER. Somehow I doubt that."
" Reasonably good...but far too clichéd to be called ""great""
",,"This movie is a fine way to spend 140 minutes, but is by no means a movie of the first rank. The script is far too simplistic, cliché-ridden and predictable. The characters are far too good guy/bad guy dualistic; and for a story purporting to take place over the course of 20 years, there is remarkably little character development. And, just about every really evil character gets his comeuppance, whereas the people we're supposed to be rooting for end up in clover. Hmmmm....Among prison movies, Cool Hand Luke is better--more realistic, and without the obligatory Hollywood feel-good ending. Runaway Train and Papillon are also very good, certainly more interesting. Among inspirational movies, last year's October Sky is a better bet.In a nutshell: tremendously overrated, but certainly worth seeing."
" Prison Movie???
",,When I signed up for the IMDB they ask you what your favourite movie is? Shawshank rose to the top of my mind immediately.  This film brought hope and inspiration to most hopeless and soul robbing of environments.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are fantastic! Does Steven King have more stories like this one?
" This movie takes its time.
",,"I loved this movie! Beautifully filmed, the story is told as if time does not matter. No plot that has to be rushed through, no fast cars or anything. Just a very good story by Stephen King, marvellous actors and a lot of exciting emotions. It made me feel good to watch a man who keeps his hope for so many years.The scene with the Mozart-record broke my heart!"
" Ghastly, Junk Film
",spoiler,"""The Shawshank Redemption"" or ""Shawshank"" as I'm sure it's said to death in the film is an elongated short story that just 'lingers' from one hour to the next. There's no real 'charm' to the film except of course 'dry wit' from Red as if it's the gospel according to Red. He basically plugs Andy the entire movie as if he's his agent. ""Now Andy this"" and ""Andy that"". Not to mention a walking brochure for penitentiaries ""Shawshank this"" and ""Shawhank that"" his gospel just never lets up.Now Tim Robbins was perfectly cast for about 5 minutes playing 'the babe in the woods' who ""looks like a stiff breeze would blow him over"" a ""tall drink of water with a silver spoon up his ass"". But once nothing seems to break him, its definitely a part for Mel Gibson. Tim Robbins didn't have the 'acting chops' to bring the 'required depth' to this character. Fortunate for Robbins in post production Morgan Freeman saved his ass with extensive voice overs. Most people think this was premeditated but 'the truth' is Robbins gave such a wooden performance it was necessary.Most people think this isn't your average prison drama ether because its not about violence and melodrama. But 'the truth' is this film is no better than your TV movie of the week that features a 'prison escape'. The whole 'poster thing' couldn't be more 'implausible' if an elephant hang from a cliff by a daisy. Don't let me get started on how he just happened to have the cell on the end ether! The music was 'elevator music' at best. The only time I even took notice was when they actually featured it in the plot And even then if I'd heard it id have personally punctured my eardrums. Why the 'sound' was nominated for an academy award is beyond me. If it weren't for packaging and distribution this film would be a made for TV movie. Which it was if you consider its box office taking against home rental.The entire cast reeked 'cartoon'. You have your 'evil' warden with his 'religion'. You have your 'mean' guards you 'grow to love'. Not to mention 'the kid', 'the old guy', 'the black guy' and 'the guys'. The prison was so stereotypical it even had 'fags'. Some other failings of this 'pathetic' movie. The dialogue was 'harebrained'. If it was supposed to fascinate, well, it 'failed'. The manner in which the mini stories unfolded was 'not stimulating'. His ability to get beers and do taxes in particular 'sucked'.In short this film 'sucked'. Worst film 'since', well since ever!"
" Boring.
",,All the drama of a falling rock.  If SK lived in the Victorian Age this would be a morality play--and both would be dead and forgotten by now--just the idea of it makes me want to live another 100 years or so.
" Brutal Anti-Bible Bigotry Prevails Again
",,"Boy, this is a very popular film, and one of the reasons Liberals love it so much - in addition to the fact that it's an interesting story and well-acted - is the anti- Christian bias in here, which is very strong.You see, the villain, as in almost all modern-day prison films, is the warden. And, they go out of their way to show you that the despised hate-filled warden is a Bible Believer, of course. It's repeated and demonstrated several times as the warden quotes Scripture. And our hero (Tim Robbins) carves out the middle the Bible to use as a place to hide a tool for him to escape. Heaven forbid, the Book would be used for him to actually read! It's no coincidence since this is written by famous author and Christian-basher Stephen King.Amid the bigotry is an interesting story with two likable lead characters (the other being Morgan Freeman, whose narration in the film is superb) and a very satisfying ending. Along the way we get other clichés, such as the usual sadistic guard (Clancey Brown) who beats up defenseless nice guys. This movie is so manipulative it's laughable.....but entertaining, especially if you're another Bible basher are another naive Lib who thinks that jails are filled with intelligent, sweet-natured guys like Freeman, Robbins, et al. In the world of film-making, criminals are the real ""victims ""of our horrible society."
" It is the #2 film of all time but is it any good? No!!
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie about a hotshot banker named Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins) who is convicted of murdering his wife and is imprisoned in Shawshank Prison. He remains hopeful and makes friends especially with a blackmarketeer named ""Red""( Morgan Freeman). I really don't see how this movie could possibly be the #2 film of all time, the movie is nothing groundbreakingly amazing, it is pretty poorly directed, the plot is thinner than air,there are no risks taken,and there is no thought provoked through watching the film that it only needs to one viewing to get the whole movie, in fact you wouldn't even need to watch the film to even understand how the movie is going end. The title already gives away the whole ""big"" finale of the movie. I don't see how anyone could possibly compare THIS to actually great movies like EVERYTHING that is below is on the Top 25. And the simple thought of this winning Best Picture back in '94, HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!, it would have given me somethingh to laugh at for the rest of my life, I still can't possibly see how the Academy could have even nominated this as the Best Picture of 1994. Anyway the only thing that saves the film of Morgan Freeman and it is only thing that even got me to see this film in the first place but it still can't stop me from giving this a poor grade.2/10"
" unintentionally campy trash

" Why does everyone like it so much?
",,"I'm sorry I don't mean to offend people who like this film but what on earth is all the fuss about over this film it is nothing compared to The Godfather and yet people vote it as second to the number 1!? The Shawshank Redemption has a relatively simple plot ,dull camera work the script is full of soppy language (thanks to the overrated Steven King)that just isn't particularly clever in any way.The atmosphere of 'prison' is totally unrealistic all the characters are wimps.The only good element is Morgan Freeman because he's a good actor.There aren't any clever twists-for instance the 'mystery' of what is in the box at the end of the film is really unoriginal. Please feel free to argue with me over this but come on people step back and look at the film what is it made up of? Then look at The Godfather look at what that is made up of - Brill cast, excellent plot, damn good script, good directing and camera work everything is perfect then look back at the Shawshank redemption its just at a completely different level. Its quite ridiculous really."
" What a bad movie
",,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It's so Hollywood cliche ! How can this be in the top 2 best movies ever ? I don't understand it. Avoid at all cost, this movie is boring !"
" Overrated
",,"It's not a bad film.  It's just derivative and melodramatic.  It borrows from ""Cool Hand Luke,"" a superior film.  It relishes its significance too much.  It's a bit smug.  Morgan Freeman's voiceover is a clumsy narrative device.  I don't know -- I just know for sure it's not one of ""the best films of all time.""  Not even close."
" sentimental garbage
",,"There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this maudlin Hollywood package. The storyline is predictable; the characters and performances are one-dimensional; the dialogue is absolutely embarrassing (""Prison is not a fairy tale."" Ya think?!) If it would have been about women instead of men, it would have been dismissed as the schmaltzfest that it is. It isn't even courageous enough to admit that it is a gay love story. Tim Robbins should be ashamed to have taken part, for his performance was the most wooden I'd seen since Daryl Hannah in (insert any 80s movie she appeared in here). Morgan Freeman was even more dreadful and has been giving the same dreadful performance ever since. I don't expect much depth from Stephen King-inspired movies, but ""Children of the Corn"" was insightful in comparison to this dribble."
" Unbearably dull
",spoiler,"I can't think of any movie more monstrously overrated than The Shawshank Redemption. Giving it only one star may seem harsh but considering all the undeserved praise heaped on this mediocre and dull movie I think it's fair. I watched it on TV and it is good enough for some entertainment for a few hours if you're too tired to do anything else but that's about it. It is predictable and unimaginative: innocent guy (well we never learn if he is if I remember correctly but as he is such a nice fellow we're supposed to think so), sexually assaulted, escapes and there you have it and that's all there is to it. Of course Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are good actors but I can't think of anything more nice to say about this movie."
" Why is it rated Number 1?
",,"I don't understand how this movie managed to get to Number one on this site. While it's a good movie with talented actors, it's just not as entertaining and solid as other movies that i believe deserve the top ranking. I enjoyed watching it, and it really doesn't deserve the 1/10 rating I've given it (thats only to bring it lower on the top 250) it just isn't as good as other movies I have seen and loved such as 'Trainspotting', 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Donnie Darko' for example. These movies are solid performances with a strong theme in one direction, while I feel that The Shawshank Redemption flounders around with it's, slightly lame, hope and friendship theme, thats just not as entertaining as others."
" Not a bad movie, but also not a very entertaining one
",,The problem with this movie is that it is to ordinary. It seems like the movie is just a cheap feelgood flick that has an ending that is easily predicted. I didn't care much for the characters and the narration was pretty annoying. I've read the book and it's a good adaptation. See it if your a Stephen King fan or like Dramas.
" How could one movie be so terrible
",spoiler,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen! I mean how many times have we seen a movie about some guy, in this case Andy Defresne played by Tim Robbins, being sent to prison because he murdered his wife and then many years later he escapes using a spoon or something to escape from the prison. The acting isn't really great, the story is flat like a pancake, and Frank Darabont's direction really shows that this was a first-time effort. The movie is absolutely WAY too predictable, the title The Shawshank Redemption already gives away the ending of the movie, which I felt way too cheesy and fake to believe. In conclusion, I don't see how this movie even got the Best Picture nomination back in '94, I guess the Academy felt sorry for this film. You should either get busy livin' watching true classics that are below this film on the Top 250, or get busy dyin' watching this garbage.
0/10"
" Ridiculously Overrated
",,"This film should barely scratch out a spot in the top 250, let alone be one of the top ranked films of all time. It is rather dull, extraordinarily predictable, and filled with clichés. This is not even the best prison film, let alone #2 among all films! Cool Hand Luke or Papillon anyone? I'd give it a 7-8/10 (Freeman & Co. do not disappoint), but someone needs to bring down this bloated rating. The film is little more than a rehashing of conventional sentimentalism painted in prison stripes and sold in bulk to a (apparently) gullible audience. Help bring this down to a reasonable position so that more deserving films can attain their proper recognition."
" How is this #1?
",spoiler,"At the time of this review, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is the number one movie on IMDb. Why? If anything, it is probably the most clichéd film I have ever seen with my own two eyes, and yet it is rated as the top film of all time? It blows my mind every time I visit this website.This 'film' was adapted from a novel by the renowned author Steven King. I have not read the book, as I have already been spoiled by the movie, but apparently the writing is quite exquisite. However, Frank Darabont must have missed the entire point of Steven's works, which is to have engaging characters that you are able to sympathize with.The characters are so bland, I might as well be staring at glue dry. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's bromance literally develops right out of the blue after they have one conversation. Pacing? What's that? Later, you meet an old fart named Brooks, who might as well have his name changed to ""I'm going to die later so feel sad-larry"", and the most he contributes to the film is increasing the runtime with his sub-plot about being outside after being locked in for so long. One cannot forget the oh-so-memorable (sarcasm) warden who channels the spirits of every Disney villain without the accompanying song. You can find more interesting characters in a Tyler Perry movie.The worst part of the movie is definitely the passage of time. The story takes place over twenty years or so and yet the only one to actually age is the warden. Tim and Morgan stay in some special cells where they magically do not get older and therefore nobody notices on IMDb. While a competent director would have noticed this as soon as they glanced at the script, Darabont was off in the broom closet shagging the catering chick or something.If you enjoy modern shooters then you are in for a treat. Most of this movie is full of grays, browns, mixes between, and it even has a sewer section just for the hell of it. Just when you thought the movie might get interesting when out of the prison, prepare to be disappointed. Honestly, the best shot of the movie is when Tim is crawling through sh*t, as it reflects on my feelings towards the film.Music can make - or break - a movie. Here, the 'original' score only seems to try and make you cry at the most inappropriate times. The music is too overplayed in films like this, where it takes away from the already terrible experience.This movie is as lame as they come. If you like this, fine. As the phrase says, ""ignorance is bliss""."
" if this film is #2 of all time, then i am Jesus Christ returning to burn this trash

This movie is okay. However, it should not be rated so high, as there are more deserving films. I have to admit, this movie had no emotional impact on me whatsoever when I saw it. I find it interesting it was able to touch so many people. I still think there was a conspiracy to boost the rating of this movie."
" The Shawshank Redemption
",spoiler,"-Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."
" Have we gone over the top with this film?
",,"Many folk rate Shawshank Redemption as one of the best films they have ever seen. I'm not so impressed. Firstly, I agree that the absence of special effects is a boon in any 1990s film. Secondly, Freeman and Robbins act well and are well-directed. The storyline, though, lacks subtlety (not in the telling - this is a very well directed film - but as a story) and Dufesne comes over as a kind of everything-he-touches, incarcerated upper-middle class Forrest Gump. The film is suffused with a kind of Manichean morality which tips over too readily into sentimentality (again, despite the best efforts of Freeman and Robbins) and which, ultimately, I found cloying.Perhaps, though, I'm being too harsh. Is it just that the film is a lot better than the story from which it is taken? Rita Hayworth: eat your heart out?"
" Very good movie, still overrated!!!
",,"The story's quite plain, the acting is OK but nothing really over the top, even though the soundtrack, the quality of the shots and the atmosphere really stood out! I think it's for obvious sentimental reasons that people like this movie! The good guy takes a lot of crap but wins in the end because he's smart!! There are way better movies than this one and I really can't understand why so many people rate it 10!! 10 equals perfection and very few pieces of art come close to it!! I think 7 is a very high rating and this movie probably doesn't deserve more than an 8 maximum!! The masses don't necessarily appreciate subtle art and want to be entertained, that's what the movie industry is about! Still, this movie was quite gay! Way too much emo and way to predictable!"
" Subtlety, and the Lack Thereof
",,"Shawshank Redemption is a story of, well, Redemption. Just like any film from Quentin Tarantino, but with an extra dose of melodrama. Orchestral music to drive you to tears, overly dramatic dialog, and plot twists that come so far out of left field even M. Night Shylamalan would cringe. You just have a hard time seeing them, because the movie is relatively laid back.Which is the best part of the film. It slows down whenever it needs to take its time. It's the story of two prisoners who bond over. One is a wrongfully accused man hoping to find a way out. One is a man who has given up all hope. And random acts of kindness help them earn their redemption.See, it's about Redemption. It's in the title. No use thinking about the theme. Morgan Freeman is perfectly cast in this film, and gives one of the best performances in his life. But every one of his lines is not the line of a prisoner, but somebody who has been paid to pretend to be a prisoner.The movie lacks any sense of reality, from the poorly supervised chain gang, to the subplot of the sinister warden, and even down to the fact that a man is allowed to keep a tool made for chipping away rocks in his cell.The film would have worked as a stage play easily. Because we expect this detachment from reality. But this film likes to pretend this is reality. The film also likes to make conclusive statements, and then immediately retract them.This movie has a heart. It spills out all over the screen while we watch the characters monologue, getting to the point of the movie over and over again. Long movies never bothered me. On the contrary, I think it's a shame four hour movies never get released these days. Still, when it's two and a half hours plus of monologues reiterating the same plot point, it's two and a half hours too much."
" Yawn
",,"I cannot believe that this movie has rec'd the accolades it has. I thought was mediocre at best and at worst saccharin, predictable, neatly cathartic and only mildly believable. I think that if it didn't contain the rape scenes, it would have been so sweet that I would have turned it off before I regurgitated. This is not to say that I enjoyed those scenes - I didn't - but it appeared that it was Frank Darabont's sophomoric attempt at instilling some sense of prison reality into an otherwise boring story about male bounding. I personally would not recommend this movie to anyone."
" don't be silly
",,"having this movie in your top ten best films of all time is like saying the greatest pieces of art ever painted are the ones they put on hotel walls. Maybe this is true in a sort of egalitarian, democratic and mind-numbingly banal way. A thoroughly ordinary film, that has been embraced by men who want to cry, have faith, and have equilibrium. Which is nice."
" Definitely on my top 1000 list
",spoiler,"I hadn't seen this film until today and I never would have rented it if I hadn't seen that it was so high up on the top 250. It wouldn't have been a great loss. It's a pretty good movie, but a bit sappy for my taste. Gives you lots of warm feelings inside about persistence through adversity, hope, friendship and all that good stuff. If you're into that, it is very well put together and it features some good acting and a beautiful score. Oh, and -- this could be considered a SPOILER given that it's a prison movie -- the ending is so nice and so predictable and so cute and so corny, it just hurts. Art, it is not."
" Above average, but not great.
",,"While the acting is rather good, not all performances are flawless, nor matched with each other as well as they could be (see Godfather 1 and 2, Goodfella's, even Pulp Fiction for near flawless ensemble acting in films).The film works but is a multi-derivative film, borrowing similar characters from several films and fashioning a film of fairly corny and unbelievable melodramatic moments to ultimately preach a message of hope.While it's an entertaining film, it's not a very good film at all.  It's strongest moments are borrowed from prison films as far back as 1930's Up the River which starred Spencer Tracy and Humphrey Bogart (in his second role).   While Shawshank is superior overall than some of the film it borrows from, it does not go any place other films have not already been before.  While at times it borders on being brutal, it still is completely done with a rose colored glasses sensibility.  Were it to more accurately portray any semblance of what the situation would be like it would be at times very difficult to watch and emotionally exhausting--which this film is not.I am rather surprised it has received such high praise from so many.  I suppose if voters would see films such as Attica, Breaker Morant, Brubaker, Cool Hand Luke, Cry Danger, The Glass House, Papillon, Pressure Point (1962), Riot in Cellblock 11, Short Eyes, and Yol for starters (films which concern men who are prisoners), they would realize how much of this film is borrowed from prior films."
" Good but not great
",,"The good points of this movie have already been stated in the other posts, so I will stick to the points I feel detracted from the movie. This movie never gripped me, I never really felt all that emotionally involved with the characters.  Even though 19 years passed in the story, I never got the sense of time passing as I have in other movies that have storylines that span decades.  All the characters who weren't prisoners were very one-dimensional.  Overall, it was a pretty good movie, but I don't think it belongs in the top 250."
" Exceptional
",,"This film is probably the best life-in-prison film ever made.  It depicts one man's time in the big house for something he (supposedly) didn't do. This man is Andy Dusfresne (pronounced Duframe) played in his best ever, Tim Robbins.  But he isn't alone; he is joined by fellow inmate (who is the only guilty person in Shawshank) Red played also very well by Morgan Freeman. Freeman narrates the life in The Shawshank prison all the way up until the end (not to mention some very memorable escape scenes).  Very memorable, showing what movies are made of.  Based on Stephen King's novel (one of his best) and adapted for the screen and directed by Frank Darabont, who 5 years later would write and direct the Green Mile, another good (but can't be matched to this one) prison movie.  A++"
" Impossibly overrated
",,"Don't get me wrong - I liked this movie just fine, I just don't understand how it deserves the *heaps* of rapturous praise it regularly receives from IMDb members, and the fact that is has been ranked at #2 in the hallowed IMDb Top 250 for the past 8 years or so just baffles me. It was certainly entertaining enough, and very well-acted, but also way over-long, and filled with the usual stock characters that seem to inhabit every prison drama (if Hollywood movies are to be believed, prison wardens are mainly just nasty SOB's and the inmates are just the best bunch of guys you'd ever want to meet). I'd recommend the movie as a good renter, but I guess I can't see it as any more than that. I realize I am way in the minority on this, however."
" Why can't I put 0??
",spoiler,This movie is terrible from the awful performance from Morgan freeman to the lazily put together story it was hard to sit through this. The dialogue was trash and the movie looked bland and boring. The poster is the main reason the movie sucks tho because I don't like how like how the poster looks
" The great film of the Great History..
",spoiler,The film does not need in a rewiew. This film is a legend in the cinematography.
" Absolutely overrated.
",,"A very boring and very predictable story.
I can not understand why this movie is hyped so."
" .
",,Most beautiful movie i have ever seen in my life i love morgan freeman and tim robins acting in this movie.
" Best movie ever
",,"Absolute best movie I have ever saw. Hands down the acting is out of this world and the story is amazing. I felt that Tim Robbins performance was perfection. I thought all of the other characters were very believable in their respective roles, from Red being the guy who can get things to Brooks, who played the best character as the man afraid to reneter civilization after a lifetime behind bars."
" A Prison Story that will leave you wanting...
",,"I thought I had never seen this movie before and then I happened upon it on TV. Then I realized I was required to see this movie in public school(in which I zoned out with boredom).Basically it's a campy Forest Gump-like story of prison with the common tropes of rape and racism--but nothing like a real prison for most people--I mean who goes to prison and gets a cushy office job? It's okay for a generic movie but as a prison story you will be left wanting.In fact, here are a few reasons to see a different movie: 1 - The escape plan: It's silly and simple. Makes you think the prison was run by complete idiots. Escape from Alcatraz with Clint Eastwood is much better.2 - The final escape: pretty anti-climatic. Just finally happens and then movie is basically over. Once again, go see Escape from Alcatraz if you're expecting extensive tunneling/swimming or something that makes you feel like the prisoner earned their freedom.3 - If you want a prison story about that best captures the essence of the desire to be free watch Papillon. It's roughly based on the French penal colony system during WW2 and numerous escape attempts."
" IMDb and the Greatest Film of All Time
",,"Two imprisoned men (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.Is this the greatest film of all time? IMDb would have you believe so. Despite being a box office flop (that barely recouped its budget), the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.And it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins' best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman."
" Shawshank Overrated
",,"This film is very overrated by seemingly sensible people. It is a remarkably emotional film on a par with various pulpy Catherine Cookson films. Talking of pulp, Pulp Fiction is awesome in comparison, as is The Shining. That Shawshank is voted Number One on many movie charts, is absolute madness. I have seen it on various occasions and via various media. And I cannot work out why people have it in such high regard. Over. Rated. Fact. Also, the film has no air of being cool or stylish in any way - it has no wow-factor of great cinematography in the way a film like Let The Right One In has for example. It has no black humour. It is tame by comparison to other films. It has no astounding scenes which Pulp Fiction has by the truckload. It has no atmosphere which a film like The Shining has by the snow-plough load. Shawshank at Number One - Absolute Madness."
" There is definitely no better movie...
",,"There are only a few words I have to say: Every time I watch that film, I have to cry. There are not many films, which get this result. Must have something to do with the direction of Frank Darabont. And the acting of the stars is just brilliant. As a matter of fact, I don't see Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins playing just another role. I only see two Persons: Andy and Red For a long time I had the problem that when I saw Tim Robbins in another movie I thought of Andy Dufresne But now I will write something about the story: Of course I have read the original story written by Stephen King. It was, in a way different. It has not that deep meaning that is perceptible in the movie. When I think about this friendship between the two men... The sentence ""Get busy livin or get busy dyin"", well in a way it shaped my whole live. This is definitely the best film I have ever seen"
" My best Film ever
",,"This film touches me. I believe it's the greatest film because I has an effect on people's lives. We watch a lot of films everyday but hardly we refer back to them.This is a film I apply in everyday life. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things. The part I liked most is when Red said ""some birds are not meant to be caged; they'll fly away and when they do, that part of you that knows it was a sin to have locked them up does rejoice...""Indeed we should build our lives such that circumstances cannot cage us. All the while Andy was in the prison, his mind was outside.Indeed, salvation lies within...."
" Unpredictable!
",,"when i began to watch this movie,i just said to myself,this should be the best i ever saw in my life,judging the IMDb rating and Kinopoisk rating!and it really haven't disappointed me! i learned,that if you want something so much,and the wish to achieve a thing or to get something is bigger and greater than anything else,this will obviously happen! there is nothing more important than to believe in yourself,to believe in justness, in the right choice of destiny! there are things that i disliked in the movie,but those awesome moments just overcome all the misses! I'm gonna watch it again...cause there still remain a lot of meanings and messages that i must follow! Hope is the best thing that can ever happen to you! never loose it!"
" Best ever...
",,"I saw this film back in '95 in Romania. Funny thing - it's translated title there was ""Angels' Prison""...I don't if it's the best ever made, for sure it's the one I liked the most. the film is about friendship - one thing who became pretty rare nowadays - and is simply magic, don't have any other words to add except that I've logged in on IMDb' site just to be able to vote and make sure it stays no. ONE. So it had 7 Oscar nominations, walked away with nothing. That tells me nothing folks, I only remember the emotions I experienced when I saw it. I'am not a touchy one but Shawshank did it for me, big time. And one final word, please don't forget Stephen King in all this, just because he had commercial success doesn't mean he's not great."
" Jaw-droppingly Great Film - At the Top of Everyone's List!
",,"There are so many reviews here that it'd be amazing if anyone gets this far down the List, but it just proves how excellent this film is. Why didn't it win the Best Picture Oscar? Simple, because the Oscar voters, like most of us, hadn't seen it yet. Most people blame the title and the title does nothing to sell the film. It sounds like a religious film as did ""Deliverance"". It was definitely not promoted well at all. I would bet the farm that most people on this list of reviews DID NOT see it in a theater. I didn't, but since my first viewing of it on DVD, I've seen it at least 6 times. I loaned my DVD out to friends, relatives and neighbors and not one of them said it was less than excellent, and I'm talking some fussy movie watchers and folks who rarely watch movies. Why? Because it's an engrossingly fabulous story, told extremely well by gifted filmmakers and crew. It has everything a great movie has to have...stunning cinematography, crisp, swift-moving direction, an intelligent script, an emotionally moving score, a top-notch cast and more. If there's anyone who saw ""it"" coming, I'd say you're fibbing, as it is anything but predictable. What more can one say! Excellent!"
" Simply !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
",,"What can I say about this movie; simply awesome, adorable, great, brilliant, excellent, the best ever movie I have seen in my entire life. Surely it is worth to be on the top for decades. When I got to know about this movie I watched it and to my surprise it was zillions time better than I thought. Even the new sensation ""The Dark Knight""(which is the best in its genre with the legendary acting by late Heath Ledger) could not match with this.I have watched movie so many times and even now not bored of it.The greatest performances from the actors Morgan Freeman (who is my favorite actor) and Tim Robbins is worth a watch.The story had every thing about the prison life, the friendship bonding, about the HOPE(never to loose). The supporting cast was also very convincing and realistic.I will give it 10 if I can will give it more than that.I suggest you all to watch it and am sure u will love........... it............................."

I should have seen it much before, I guess. I am truly moved by the story and more than that by the character roles played by Morgan (Red) and Tim (Andy). I have to admit, this is not one of the greatest, BUT THE GREATEST movie ever produced.Brooks was there, so was Red... I wish I was also there to see it for real.This movie gave me new avenues, new thoughts, new energy and more than everything... it gave me what it gave Morgan Freeman... HOPE"
" Simply Incredible
",,"I know tons of people have commented on this masterpiece already but I feel the need to make another one. First of all the plot, the conclusion, the acting, and the narration are classic. Morgan Freeman can make a movie just with his voice (but for the record this movie is so good it doesn't need it).There's no action or explosions just great actors committing to their roles and making it seem as if you know the characters personally. When I had just finished watching this the other night, I started watching Family Guy and a joke about Andy Dufresne and the sisters came on. Although I didn't find it to be very funny I thought to myself ""Hey I know that movie!""When I finished watching it I thought about how it good it was and how it made me feel about myself for a good day and a half.If you like movies that are not just put out to entertain watch this movie, trust me you won't be disappointed."
" Best movie ever.
",,"Ill make this short. I got two versions of this DVD in my collection, in case one of them gets broken.Excellent acting by Robbins and Freeman, plus all the other bi-characters. Thomas Newman's music in the background makes the moments so sore and intense that you forget everything else. Some critics might say its a sentimental cry-baby movie, but forget about it. Ask the biggest moron you can find on a monster-bike and ill bet he remembers this movie.If you haven't seen the movie, go see it. If you have seen it, go see it again."

Don't get me wrong, there are other brilliant films but this this one stands out amongst all others, if you haven't seen this movie then i strongly advise that you make it your #1 priority.11/10"
" Good things never die.
",,"'The Shawshank Redemption' is that rare exception that transcends film itself to become a moving and harrowing experience. Based on a short story by Stephen King and brought to life for the big screen by Frank Darabont, one can only watch in awe as this story touches true greatness. Superb performances, commanding direction, smothering atmosphere, beautifully bleak cinematography. All the pieces come together, and do they ever. This is worth more than just a second look, this a modern masterpiece.There's a great sense of inspiration that can be found at the center of 'The Shawshank Redemption', and that's a story of hope. Hope through all that life throws at you, hope in midst of uttermost despair. We go on a journey with these characters, and their stories remain with us long after we leave them. Andy's attempt to maintain hope and Red's struggle to allow the thought of it into his life is a powerful story to be told, highlighted by the fantastic performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.What else is it but art? If a film can reach out beyond the annals of cinema and become larger than itself, something more than a movie to be entertained by, can it be considered art? 'Shawshank' marked Frank Darabont's first venture into the work of Stephen King ('The Green Mile' and 'The Mist' would follow), and it arguably remains his best and most accomplished effort to date. His ability to set the tone and create its smothering prison atmosphere instantly grabs your attention and never relinquishes it.'The Shawshank Redemption' is a deeply moving picture that has to be experienced, not observed. Felt, not merely seen. It tells an intricate story of extreme magnitude, leaving in its footsteps a poignant tale of hope and freedom. Allow yourself to be taken where films rarely go, the tragic beauty of it all is nearly overwhelming. A sweeping work of art to remind us that above all else, when all seems to be lost, never give up hope. As Andy tells Red, hope is a good thing. And no good thing ever dies.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"
" ""The Movie Of the Millennium""- A True Masterpiece
",,"The movie really seems to have moved me. Its a Story that arouses hope within an individual. it reminds me of the famous lines from the a great poem that ""when winter comes spring cant be far behind"".The movie revolves around the two character Andrew Dufresne and Red. Andy Dufresne, is sent to Shawshank Prison for the murder of his wife and secret lover. He is very isolated and lonely at first, but realizes there is something deep inside your body, that people can't touch and get to....'HOPE'. Andy becomes friends with prison 'fixer' Red (Morgan Freeman), and Andy epitomizes why it is crucial to have dreams. His spirit and determination, leads us into a world full of imagination, filled with courage and desire. This is about how he spreads his message of hope through the Shashank Redemption!!!A must watch!! although it may don't seem so great at the beginning but the ending is marvelous which makes it a masterpiece!!! Do watch it...."
" Simply stunning

" Perfect Film!

Whatever the case may be, the point is this, this film is perfect! Whether your 15 or 80, this movie should deeply movie you. I know that I was when I first saw it. I don't remember the exact age I was when I saw it, but I do remember how much this film made me care about the life I have today.This Film is a personal favorite of mine, not just because of what a great film it is, but because it's a film my father and I have seen over 200 times together. The film really analyzes the bond between two friends and that's how I see my father and I.This film is absolutely brilliant. Morgan Freeman's best performance. I think the music and the cinematography go VERY unnoticed in the film, I thought they were both brilliant. This film is perfect in every sense of the word and I believe should've won the Oscar for best picture over 'Forrest Gump'(even though I truly loved this film).If you haven't already seen 'The Shawshank Redemption' please do yourself a favor, go to your local videostore, spend the seven dollars and watch it. Its worth every penny.This film is a true American classic."

I don't think that any one having a little bit of intellectual level would dislike this movie."
" Good, but not great - grossly overrated
",,"I'm constantly amazed by the praise heaped on this film. I've always seen it as a good film, but too clichéd to rate as as truly great one.On the plus side, it has high production values, has a good performance from Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, and it's well-paced until close to the end.But the downsides are legion.First of all, some of the secondary characters are utterly two-dimensional (particularly Warden Norton and Captain Hadley). They lumber through the film as such obvious and simplistic bad guys that they may as well have moustaches and wear black hats.Secondly, the film cranks out every prison cliché in the book. The assaults, the corrupt wardens, the ex-con who can't handle the outside world, the withdrawals of privileges - all have been done before and with considerably more impact.Thirdly, there are plot holes you could crawl through (as Andy does!). The notion that Andy Dufresne could dig a tunnel for 20 years without being spotted isn't up-lifting, it's ridiculous. Did no-one feel the draught? Did no-one lean against the poster when they visited him in his cell? As a resolution, it's not clever, just silly.And the finale (from the tunnel to the beach) is overlong and overwrought.And yet there are standout sequences. The scene where Andy locks himself into the Warden's office and blasts an aria from Mozart's Marriage of Figaro over the prison Tannoy is sublime and haunting.An enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours, but no more than that."
" A true masterpiece
",,"I would recommend this movie to everyone. The acting, directing, cinematography are all top notch. The cast are so good that its hard to imagine anyone else in those roles. If this movie does not make you laugh and then at, the very least, make you cry a little bit, then you have no soul.The greatest movie never to have won an academy award - no doubt. The greatest movie of all time - possiblyIf you have never seen this movie you are lucky, because i will never again be able to see it for the first time.A truly heart-warming and inspiring piece of cinema. Awesome"
" Amazing!!
",,"I cant find another word to describe this movie. AMAZING! The title is so horrible and i never expected i would watch it for 30 minutes. But when i saw it, i realised the big mistake in not watching it earlier.The movie has a beautiful plot set over 20 years. Every part of the movie has a bearing on the ending. And never did i imagine such a spectacular ending. Not many movies can boast of a suspense of such a kind. This movie is not a thriller, nor is it adventure; but it is a desire of a Man who lives on Hope and who paves his own Destiny. Shawshank Redemption leaves you with a elated mind and a moral that it is fear that holds you back and Hope that carries you forward. I have only one message for IMDb viewers. Just watch Shawshank Redemption. Do not avoid it because the title is bad or else you too will have the same wretched feeling that i had today. Wish i had seen it when i did have an opportunity a decade ago. Well.. sometimes, cinema is like this. You go for titles, stars and big buck films and come back home disappointed. But Shawshank Redemption proves that all you need is a excellent script, a good director and some thespians like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins."
" HOPE IS THE BEST THING!
",,"Many of the most powerful stories are the soulful ones that teach us not to despair, not to be swamped by sorrow. They remind us that ¡° hope¡± is a precious and buoyant emotion that can give our lives substance and meaning. Most people who see this movie for the first time are not going to appreciate it completely, I feel that it is quite possible the best movie ever made. Some may be more entertaining, like say Indian Jones and the last Crusade, but none as compelling. The movie shows a world of different emotions, mainly through its two main characters, Red and Andy. The acting is incredible. The message is stronger than that of most any movie, and is stated very clearly. ¡° Hope¡± is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever does.¡± After being drained by the sad events that occur in the movie, the ending uplifts, and thoroughly fulfills the gap that it could leave you with.I believe that one reason that this movie is under appreciated is that people have not seen it multiple times. At first viewing it is the story of Andy and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances. However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find different path of freedom that is lit by hope. No matter what circumstances you live in, don¡¯t forget that hope is the best thing in the world. And you will have courage to struggle, to forward, and to live better in the world."
" Very well but far from a masterpiece
",,"Strong, meaningful and everlasting message is what makes this movie such powerful. The Hope, the Life and the Friendship are elements of Great Impact and are well incorporated in this feature. But, lots of flaws also. This movie lacks originality. Approach, characters and dialogues are rather cliched and mold. Portraying of characters is loose and poor. Dialogues are pretty ordinary and too conventional. Overall approach is just Routine and  the whole movie is based on the Final Impact of  the story. In short, its actually not surprising no Oscar winning and no including into the 100 Greatest Movies by American Film Institute. Greater Effort in developing characters to be multidimensional and story to be less conventional would produce One of the Best. Pity. 7,5/10"
" Well-Done Everyone's Hollywood Flick without Flaw
",,"With universal themes such as redemption, friendship, and good-defeats-evil tale, and without any significant technical flaws, it may be difficult to dislike Shawshank Redemption, one of well-done Hollywood flicks in the 90s by invisible employee directors, while it may also be difficult to find it compelling, imaginative, and inspirational. Despite a prison situation Tim Robbins keeps looking ridiculously gorgeous all the time, but this is made-in-Hollywood."
" Where are the risks?
",,"Many reviews talk about how they don't have words that can describe this movie.  I have the perfect word: vanilla This movie is the Toyota Camry of movies.  Pleasant, but bland.  It doesn't take any risks, just plays it safe and the result is a pleasant experience, but not a satisfying one. I would have liked to see more risks taken.  How about some ground-breaking cinematography?  What if some of the characters pushed the envelope a little further?  Far enough to be accused of overacting by some?  How about a parallel story?  How about SEVERAL parallel stories? What about moving the story at a faster pace?  The beginning of the movie was really quite slow...There is no reason this movie should be more than 2 hours.  I give it only a 7 out of 10 for breaking no new ground.  I think this movie fails to distinguish itself in my memory."
" My Review of this Great Movie
",,Well there's not much you can say about this movie except that it is the Best movie of all time and no other Movie will top this great Great movie If you have not seen it sit back clear your mind and watch it and make sure you are not bothered while watching it that way you can fully understand the film and its purpose.So out of a 1-10 scale I give it a 10+++++++ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT RENT IT!!!!!!!!
" ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF THE DECADE
",,"When I first saw this movie i was 16 and wasn't allowed in the theatre since it was rated R.  I asked some of the people standing in line if they would let me come in with them.  I don't know why I wanted to see it so much(the trailer wasn't that great).  But when I sat down and watched that opening sequence where the judge slams down that gavel for the poor Mr Dufresne and Red comes walkin in to the parol board i knew i was in for something special.  The cinematography  of that old prison was amazing.  As we hear more dialog coming from the two main characters our hearts go out to these ""brave souls"".  The character development is better than in any movie i've seen for a while.  You really start to care and feel for these imaginary people as if you knew them.  The more times i watch it on my laserdisc player, the more I can't believe how anyone could not at least ""like"" this masterpiece of filmmaking.  It really got the shaft at the oscars.  Tim Robbins should have at least been nominated.  I still don't think forrest gump had as much to offer about the human experience as ""THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION"".  It really is a fantastic piece of work. Writing, acting, direction, and cinematography come together in this masterpiece."
" The book was better
",,"This wasn't a bad movie by any means, in fact it was pretty good. Good story, good acting, fairly dramatic, it has most of the key elements in place. But after reading the book, which was amazing, watching this drawn out film version just isn't the same. Compared to some of the modern junk that's out there, Shawshank is pretty solid. But overall, it truly is overrated, and #2 all time is silly."
" The last person to see this film (Probably)
",,"Well now I've finally seen it, and I have to say after the tremendous build up from everyone I've spoken to (IMDB No.2!) etc.. I thought it was ..... OK.  I think I would have scored it higher if I'd seen it five years ago but now without nostalgic hindsight it's only a 7!! Shock.. This film is still well worth seeing but the characters are not as well crafted as in 'The Green Mile' nor do they command your compassion (Brooks excepted).I suppose I'd better see 'Hannibal' SOON!"
" A fine movie, but a few things bug me.
",,"Good Movie. The first time I saw it, when it first came out in 1994, I thought that it was fantastic. But now that I have seen it approaching 15 times now (thanks to TNT), there a few things that I have noticed that have convinced me it does not deserve to be in the top ten or even the top 50 of all time.I find the film to be unrealistic. The prison seems to exist in some sort of hyper-reality where people are either bad guys or good guys but there is absolutely no grey area. The prison and the prisoners are also very clean, neither have the lived-in quality that you would expect. I do not know if this feeling I get from the movie was on-purpose by the director Darabont, but I feel as the though the authenticity of the movie is not there. I also feel as though the movie is very manipulative of the audience's emotions in the way that the story is used to make the viewer feel a certain way about a character. Of course all movies are manipulative in this way. But I am very aware of it when I watch Shawshank. I was also aware of it when I watch movies like The Green Mile or The Hurricane, I feel as though these movies do not give the audience an opportunity to decide for themselves. Lastly I think that this movie was carried by the supreme acting, and that if the Freeman and Robbins were not so good it would not even deserve to be in the top 250.Otherwise, I rooted for this movie get the oscar in 1994 because I thought it was a superior movie to Forest Gump."
" Quite simply the best film I have ever seen.
",,"This film is truly magnificent and if there is anyone out there who hasn't seen it they should get straight down to their local video shop and buy it because it is the sort of film that you will want to watch over and over again.  There is no acting in any other film that comes close to Tim Robbins and especially Morgan Freeman.  I fail to see how anyone could fault any part of this film it is, in my opinion, perfect.  The plot line is great and there is no way you could guess what is coming next and the ending is completely unpredictable."
" good thiller movie
",spoiler,This is a movie that stands the test of time and still resonates with viewers. Call this the Stand by Me of prison stories.
" The ultimate prison break
",,"When you look back at the year 1994,it gave us three gem movies- Forrest Gump,Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption. But till movie is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman have played it to perfection. The slow prison life with the usual routine is depicted in a very realistic manner. The way the plot builds is unexpected . This movies takes a sudden turn in the last 30 minutes when the world turns upside down for most. A great movie and highly recommended for everyone."

" mksl akteb review w elli t7t dah mosh bta3y
",,"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."

When I am confused and confused, I always see the film's hero crossing the sewer on a stormy night. Yes, maybe that's the invisible influence of the film; although the film has penetrating lenses on some ratings, it has not the slightest meaning expressed by the film. A movie about prison and embarrassment also has a good ending like many high-score movies. At the end of the film, the friends the hero met in prison were released on parole to fulfill his agreement with the hero, and they found an iron box. Finally, they met again on the blue Pacific coast. Although the ending was good, they also had a vengeful vent. Yeah, thanks for meeting it. It's unforgettable!"

If there was a channel that played this movie non stop 24/7 and didn't run credits the human race would be doomed.

" Hope springs eternal
",,"An outstanding prison film, it seems almost pointless to write another glowing review of a film which has amassed a 9.3 average rating on this site. What I will say is that Morgan Freeman's voice over narration as Red is arguably the simplest and most effective I have heard in any film. It adds another dimension to the on-screen action. In fact, Darabont's screenplay, which should have won the Oscar, is perfectly executed, with its strong dialogue, finely wrought characters and balanced structure. The whole film moves along beautifully, with hardly any weaknesses of note. Already a classic, this film will surely stand the test of time as one of the greats."
" 'The Shawshank Redemption'
",,"On Sept. 23, 1994, after a premiere at the Toronto film fest, The Shawshank Redemption hit theaters nationwide. The Morgan Freeman film eventually nabbed seven Oscar nominations. The Hollywood Reporter's original review is below:Castle Rock has tapped into the wellspring of yet another Stephen King novella, from the same collection as Stand by Me. While it seems unlikely that this well-wrought film about hope and friendship in a maximum security prison will do Stand by Me-level business, The Shawshank Redemption should appeal to a mature audience. The marketing challenge will be to lure a mainstream audience to this dark drama starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman with, to boot, an enigmatic title.Covering a span of time from 1946 to 1967, Shawshank focuses on the plight of a Maine banker, Andy Dufresne (Robbins), sentenced to two life terms for the murder of his wife and lover. Laconic and a bit chilly, Andy is somewhat of an outcast among the uneducated, macho thugs who make up the main brunt of the prison population.Admittedly, he's not an easy guy to get to know and only comes to enjoy a prison friendship when he makes a deal with the prison black-market supplier, Red (Freeman), to get him a tiny hammer for his rock collection. Red is also an enigma to most of the inmates. He keeps his nose clean and his hopes up even though the parole board routinely denies him pardon, obviously a racial antagonism.While the story roils with some rousing prison-type action and is coarsened by an overpowering sense of frustration, The Shawshank Redemption is really about the unlikely friendship between Andy and Red: Each nurtures the other and serves as a touchstone for keeping their sanity intact.Frank Darabont's writing and direction are generally crisp, but Shawshank is a tough watch and audiences could use some time cut from its 142 minutes.In the lead roles, both Robbins and Freeman are outstanding, layering their performances with snippets of individuality: Their small, daily sustenances and minor triumphs are wonderfully inspiring.Technical contributions are well-crafted, particularly cinematographer Roger Deakins' forbidding lensing. Filmed in a garrison-like former prison in Mansfield, Ohio, Shawshank is often overwhelming in its depiction of the granite-cold, stony horror of prison life. Most splendid is Thomas Newman's somber score, which, at its best moments, alights with radiant textures and sprightly grace notes, nicely emblematic of the film's central theme."
" Ultimate Motivation
",,Hope is the best thing.. Maybe the best of thing and no good thing ever dies
" Best Movie I Have Ever Seen
",,"There is so many thing to say about Shawshank Redemption, but I will write about major reasons why I loved it.Firstly, the plot. It is amazing work,really. And these dialogues, these shooting style. It is beyond amazing. We can easily see and understand every scene we see, I mean, in the paper. Directors and writers did an extraordinary job in this film.And acting, this film has a great cast and they obviously lived the scenes while acting. I believe that this film is the best film of both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.This, is what we always talk about when it comes to feelings about a film. We always want a movie that touches us, not just with what we see. And this film has that effect. It leaves you with your dreams and your biggest fears after the movie. And it makes you question your life. What is important?To sum up, The Shawshank Redemption is something else. Its normal for it to be the Imdb's top rated movie of all time. Every person must see this film in their lifetime."

" Best movie
",spoiler,That movie was so good. That movie is best movie in 90's.
" Inside and out, a beautifully sculpted movie with great life lessons.
",spoiler,"I think that I am a little late to the party on this one. This movie has rightfully been acclaimed as a cinematic masterpiece for quite some time now. The naked viewers eye may not have caught everything that this sentimental film has to offer.On the upper level of film analysis, we find the film very appealing to our physical senses. The basis of every great film is great writing. The film's dialogue rarely came out as cheesy, yet still carried an impactful punch. The conversations between characters always felt ernest. I found it easy to share the characters sentiments. Being someone who has worked in lock down systems such as prison, I can testify that the dialogue and writing was spot on. Something that should definitely be appreciated. 9.5/10 for writing.Still on the upper level of film analysis, the cinematography was amazingly put to use. I have never liked it when strong color tints, over done close ups and wide outs, or crazy angles are used in film. Shawshank Redemption avoids the overuse of anything too drastic with its filming style. Perhaps a smidgen overuse of the slow-paced close up technique; however, for the most part this technique really works for the films dialogue. Most conversations in the movie tend to boil down to a simple thesis put at the end of the scene. It only makes sense that the cinematography matches the flow of conversation, by narrowing in to what the audience should specifically take away. 9.9/10 for cinematographySet design is another component which was important to this particular story. It was important that there was a transition of color and feeling between each location in the film. This film truly puts the audience in locations of freedom and entrapment. 10/10Editing and directing was spot on. The film felt well paced.Now, for the lower level of film analysis (the deeper meaning). This film is a field of gold when it comes symbolism and life lessons if you ask me. This film is not only about redemption, hope, judgment, trial, captivity or freedom; it is also about the world we are uncontrollably born into. The film is sprinkled with symbolism towards birth into situations beyond our control.
The film is also a symbol of the life of Christ-- Andy being that sort symbol. For example, he is a sinless man put into suffering conditions for a crime someone committed. He is depicted as soft spoken and humble lamb who is led to slaughter. He creates his first service to his fellow inmates by supplying alcohol, a parallel to how Christ began his earthy ministry, turning water into wine at a wedding. He teaches others, he helps those who are his enemies, and he suffers at the hand of his rulers. One morning we find that his cell, the place he is to die someday, is empty- much like the tomb of Christ. He then finishes the movie by redeeming Red, the ""only guilty man in Shawshank prison"".I could go on and on about these lower level film analytics. This movie is filled with all sorts of lessons which will shine through for different audience members.Side note, I watched this movie on a editing system which took out F bombs and other foul language. For those who would only ever see this movie if edited, it is definitely worth it."
" Movie Perfection
",,"It doesn't get much better than this. Perfect performances throughout, wonderful direction... just amazed it didn't do well when first released. Time put it in its rightful place though... top of the tree!"
" Perfect entertiament
",,What can you say about this film. spawned from a short story by Stephen King and adapted into this pure masterpiece with amazing acting - highly recommend
" Amazing movie
",,"The Shawshank Redemption was one of those movies that I had heard the title to at some point in my life, though knew nothing about. One day, I was scrolling through Hulu and came across it. I decided to watch it. This was one of the best decisions that I could have made. It was enthralling to follow Andy throughout his journey in prison, and I loved that Morgan Freeman was not only a major part of the storyline, but he narrated it, and it followed his story as well. I have seen this twice now, and would definitely watch it again."
" I like this film

Although this film was produced in the 1994s, content and techniques were not bad. Image quality is also very good."

" Unique story
",,There is a movie that you should watch throughout your life
" An amazing and thought provoking film about so much more than the premise suggests that can teach us all something about life, respect, hope, and how all films should be made.
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the greatest film that had ever been made I have viewed it multiple times over the years and it never gets old. It is the story of a man imprisoned for a crime he did not commit, and then he must try with all he can to escape from there. It is a story we've seen or heard a thousand times. It is nothing new. And that is the beauty of it. We think we're here to see the same old story yet again, however, it will shock and surprise you as it unfolds. It is a story of brotherhood behind bars, of an unlikely friendship that last a lifetime, and, of redemption."
" One of the best

For example, there is one scene in particular that everyone who has watched the movie will know what im talking about when I say it hit hard, maybe a bit too hard. On the other hand, it blew me away."

" Amazing Movie with Amazing Story
",,"The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle."
" Perfect Movie
",,"At the first, I'm not really interesting with this movie but my friend always recommend it,so I watched this movie and realized that this movie is perfect hollywood movie. When I first see it, I am to young to understand all the things the movie what to show us but this movie gave me a different feeling.The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont in 1994. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King Novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption The movie is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes place. This movie makes us feel different watching this film than most others as this is an incredibly realistic film. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meants for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system.The movie had inspiring story,this is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion,from haunting and chilling, to stirring and beautiful. The Shawshank Redemption is brutal and violent at times, horrifying and sickening at others. Redemption is what this story is all about. And it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have commited,but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life. What emerges in this movie can only be called a magnificent pice of art.Overall, this movie is just absolutely stunning in so many ways. Acting pefect,emotional drama perfect,soundtrack perfect,storyline perfect, and everything about this movie is perfect. The Shawshank Redemption is the movie I've seen that has made tears of happiness come to my eyes. I think this movie reccomended for everyone who like drama,action, and humor cause this film blend it."
" me
",,"I really could not find anything worth my time in this film, and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the end, one or two good lines of dialog and the acting, there's really nothing in the whole film worth watching it for."
" me
",,"I like the story, the acting, basically everything, and I definitely recommend it to everybody."
" very good look!
",,This movie is a very good look into how easy man can get corrupted in prison or on the outside. We see that with Andy and how he became bad while he was in the prison. Also that we should have a program for prisoners so can adjust to the real world. I think with this brooks would have made it. I can see that we as a society need to have wake up call from this movie to stay strong and not let Satan get the best of you. By not giving into temptations and don't go chasing waterfalls!!!
" Timeless Classic

" a good Fim

" Does Light Cast Out Darkness
",,"The dialogue and the stellar performance of Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins along with the supporting cast set the bar high for the also-ran black/white buddy films then and now.Director Frank Darabont manages to shoot what could have been a dull and often told story of criminals behind prison walls with humanity. The story unfolds like so many others, and instead of concentrating on guilt or innocence I was drawn into the daily lives of people who were living like me the best experience they could with the resources they are allowed.Stephen King, of course, is known for his suspense, horror, supernatural, and science fiction. Shawshank Redemption I read is loosely based off of Leo Tolstoy, God Sees the Truth, But Waits. From whatever and wherever Stephen King chose to base The Shawshank Redemption writings I thoroughly enjoyed the movie as did my Aunt Evelyn as she has probably watched the movie 100 times outpacing my 30 or so more viewings. A must see if you like a storyline involving patience and redemptive promise for the future."

" Shall be considered Prison Break season 0
",,"When I seen this movie in Top250, I could not believe it, thought it was a joke. It is probably some boring old movie, maybe even without colors. But I was amazed. Similar to Prison Break series, just older version of it. Adventure, Lesson, Inspiration, Motivation, Insight, Experience, Confidence, Emotions...all in one. Good ending too. It lacks nothing. It teaches us to fight for freedom, and not just ordinary freedom like from prisons or psych wards, but freedom from people, diseases, poor life, anything negative or bad. It gives insight into feeling of being released from some institution for those who have not experienced it."

" Best Movie Ever
",,"Best Movie Ever That i Watched On The Universe
It is an unusual remark to make about a film set inside a jail, however ""The Shawshank Redemption"" makes a warm hang on our sentiments since it makes us an individual from a family. Numerous motion pictures offer us vicarious encounters and speedy, shallow feelings. ""Shawshank"" backs off and looks. It utilizes the storyteller's quiet, attentive voice to incorporate us in the narrative of men who have shaped a network in the slammer. It is more profound than most movies; about coherence in a lifetime, in view of companionship and expectation."
" good movie

Errrr... I guess that's supposed to be enemies. But in any case, who needs those extra nice-to-"
" Movie of all Movies

" Emotional, intense, yet human
",,"THis movie is one of the best that has been released over the last couple of decades and to me it is a timeless one as well. I truly believe that the story line and acting will hold up against anything out today, This movie provides viewers a story that is raw and emotional, though it is a simpler film than some it leaves an impression upon the viewer and touches something in the deepest part of our humanness."

After watching this movie first time I always speak to myself that don't give up HOPE. But it's very much hard to find friend like Red or maybe prototype like him in real world. This movie gives me strength to move on and never forget those people who left you in in your bad time, so when the RIGHT time comes you can smack them hard. Always love to watch this movie whenever I get time."

I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul. giving 8/10"
" Worthwhile to view.
",,"I don't know why I had selected the film on Hotstar, may be due to the look of Freeman on the thumbnail. But after completing the viewing there was a calm fulfilment of mind. The depth of the storyline, the conservative attitude of direction, the mesmerized background music, the excellence in lighting made the film so matured. Freeman was good as well and Gunton was superb. Thanks to the director."
" Just amazing

The actors and the screenplay is fantastic and unlike anything I've ever seen."
" Classic movie
",,One of the best movies of all time. I just loved the movie. the storyline is amazing and really catchy. The cast is perfect and did a real justice to the movie. The lead actor Tim Robbins looked like a lame character initially but as the movie progressed he just got intense and was totally hooked to the movie and kind of got institutionalized with the movie lol.!
" Darling, Never, ever lose your HOPE...

",,"Shawshank Redemption is a simple but amazing film with an everlasting message.
Although there's no action or special effects, this movie keeps you interested from the beginning to the end. You have friendships, difficulties, dreams and most importantly: you have hopes. All that Shawshank Redemption is about is ETERNAL HOPE! And I think this theme is what makes this movie so special. Not only you find something relatable (even though the circumstances that the characters are in probably have nothing to do with you), but you think about the message, about the movie. And after you watch it you feel motivated, even grateful for what you have. You feel hope. And that's exactly how you should feel because as the movie says ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."""

My friends first Persuaded me to watch it, while I thought it was going to be very boring, and now it is one of my favourite films.

The movie touches upon all parts of life from respect, accountability, intelligence, decency, friendship and much more. The movie tells us so much about us as humans and how even at the lowest moments in our lives, one can and must redeem themselves. The bond between Andy, Red, and the viewer is absolutely unbreakable and I shed tears even time I watch the movie. As I have said before, The Shawshank Redemption is the greatest movie of all time."

" Great film
",spoiler,One of my favorite films of all time Tim Robbins nailed this performance. As well as Morgan Freeman I can listen to that guy talk all day long. The only other storyline that can compare to this is The Count of Monte Cristo. I absolutely love him being defiant in his prison stay. It's like nothing on Earth could break his spirits he just didn't let it get to him. In the end everything worked out perfect I absolutely loved how he developed a third-party Persona to launder money.

" perfect

" Maybe not ""The Greatest"", but it's a triumph nonetheless
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is often referred to as the greatest film of all time. Frank Darabont's first of two Stephen King adaptations, it holds a unique place in pop culture and history.However, it is perhaps King's original story that should be regarded so highly, and not Darabont's adaptation. The film itself is magnificent, but certainly not as well-crafted as many would have you believe. There are some particular qualities that are to be admired and hailed as Hollywood greats, but The Shawshank Redemption is certainly not the greatest film ever made.Among these fantastic qualities is the performance of Morgan Freeman as Red, which will go down in history as among his finest.The strengths of the film are in its dialogue and storytelling, as well as the performances of Freeman and Tim Robbins, most of which should be credited to King and not Darabont's filmmaking.The structure of the film is nothing unique, and the shots are not experimental or special in any particular way. Darabont merely adapts the brilliance to the screen - he doesn't add any of his own artistry to the mix.When it comes to the strength of the filmmaking, The Shawshank Redemption is certainly a triumph, but nothing spectacular. Some crane shots and transitions, as well as the cinematography are excellent. However, when compared to the other 1994 classics in Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump, it is clear that this film is very much plot- and character-driven.However, it is an overwhelmingly strong plot with wonderful characters. Robbins and Freeman have fantastic chemistry that provides some of the most famed and fantastic dialogue in cinematic history.The story itself is neatly-woven and tightly-knitted, to King's credit. While he is more renowned for his horror novels, The Shawshank Redemption is perhaps King's greatest work, and this adaptation benefits from the strength of the source material.The film itself is nothing particularly special, but the performances of Robbins and Freeman and King's brilliant novel make this one of the best adaptation films of all time."
" Best Movie EVER!!!
",,I NEVER get tired of seeing this movie. I like period pieces. And the acting and cinematography is ON POINT. This is my favorite film.
" Must read
",,"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie."
" The Shawshank's Redeeming Reputation
",,"This film is really... wow...Pros;
Tim Robbin's Andy Dufrense is a unique yet compelling lead character. The way that Robbin performs him, you really can't tell whether he is a sociopathic innocent or a psychopath in general.As always Morgan Freeman is great. The casting director clearly knew this as Freeman plays Red: an elder-like character who imparts wisdom about prison life but also clever and witty. Also, his narration over much of the film is great too (Thanks to his great voice).The supporting cast are also really nice but the stand out is James Whitmore's Brooks for his emotional packing. Despite having a large amount of supporting characters, they all shine in their own way and despite little screen time, all actors leave their mark.The story (Much thanks to being adapted from Stephen Kings' book of the same name) is really polished and every single element has a payoff as the narrative continues.As previously touched upon, the film packs a large amount of emotion and stays with the audience very much.Cons;
Pfft. I guess that this was a box office failure when it came out? Well, if you were alive in 1994 and don't watch this: shame on you.Verdict;
With a suburb cast, compelling character and clever narrative, The Shawshank's Redemption is a film worth watching if ever you get the chance."

" We've Got to Get Out of This Place!
",spoiler,"At this writing I see that there is already 6,329 reviews of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" on IMDb so what the heck, I'll throw in my two cents worth.""The Shawshank Redemption"" was adapted from a Stephen King novelette about a wrongly convicted murderer's 19 year odyssey through Shawshank prison in Maine. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. We don't learn until later that he really was innocent. Andy is taken under the wing of veteran lifer Red Redding (Morgan Freeman) who shows him the ways of prison life.Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is a strict Bible thumper who together with his sadistic Captain of the Guards Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), maintain order within the prison. A convict named Bogs (Mark Rolston) sets his sights on Andy for homosexual purposes. Andy is continuously attacked by Bogs and his friends. While working on a roof top, Andy overhears Hadley's complaints over taxes on a small inheritance. Andy tells Hadley of a way in which he can avoid any taxes. As his ""fee"" Andy asks for beer for his co-workers which puts him favor with the group. Later, when Bogs and his gang rough up Andy, Hadley beats Bogs to a pulp and renders him a parapalygic.Warden Norton sees possibilities in Andy and re-assigns him to the prison library being run by lifer Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore). Andy through an exhaustive letter writing campaign, manages to gain funding from the state to expand the library along with a supply of used books. Andy does Income taxes for the guards and tutors some prisoners as well. Norton is impressed Under a scheme where prisoners are loaned out to the community for work on public projects, Norton develops a kick back scheme and employs Andy to keep the books for him.A young convict named Tommy (Gil Bellows) comes to the prison and after gaining the confidence of Andy and Red, tells a tale of a prisoner that he had shared a cell with who admitted to killing Andy's wife and lover. Andy goes to Warden Norton to seek a new trial. Norton not wanting to lose Andy because of his accounting skills, refuses to help him. An argument ensues and Andy is thrust into solitary.When he is released from solitary, Andy becomes distant and becomes a loner. What he is really doing is hatching an elaborate frame-up of Norton and his cronies while also planning to escape. One morning g at roll call Andy does not answer and......................................................................................This film deservedly was nominated for seven Academy Awards. The acting is superb. Robbins and Woodward are tremendous as the two main characters. Gunton and Brown are great as the main villains. But veteran James Whitmore almost steals the movie with his sympathetic portrayal of the paroled lifer who tries to adjust to society after 50 years in prison.A great movie."
" Purely Amazing
",spoiler,"There are many reasons why this movie is rated number 1. All reasons I understand, The music, the acting , and more importantly everything. Although I have rated The Green Mile higher, that's solely just on preference. This is by far the definition of films. Until today I never knew this was Morgan Freeman's fist time doing narration, and you would never guess that it was his first time dong one based on how perfect he does it in this. Tim Robbins is the perfect fit for this role and I can not see Tom Hanks as Andy Dufrense. The story telling in this film is marvelous and the entirety of the film has a deeper meaning. There's a reason you study this film in High School, there is so much to analyze and study. For me the best part of the movie is the ending that sweet shot of the camera zooming out of the beach and Andy walking towards Red and the music in this scene almost makes enough for you to cry. Considering how little Frank Darabont had to work with considering this film is based of Stephen Kings short story Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption he was able to stick entirely true to the novel and still make it a feature length film. The Shawshank Redemption is truly the greatest film of all time and if you haven't seen this film, I don't know what your doing with your life as this is a much."
" A true time classic
",,"It started the ""prison escape genre"" with a number of movies referencing scenes from this. A true masterpiece."
" Great Movie
",,"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through..."
" Amazing

" Wonderful Character Development and Storyline

" What makes movies 'art'

" I can watch this a million times over!
",,Absolutely one of the best films made.. It is made with such art and talent.
" Perfect
",,Very nice movie players have played very nice. director's camera angles were nice
" Fxr the best mxvie I have ever seen
",,"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."

An awesome creation"
" Unforgettable movie
",,"It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.when you see the movie you will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie."
" What a great movie!!!!!

" Timeless
",,"The review says it all, timeless. Smart educational film. From the beginning to the end. Tim Robbins at first, you assume he is either a wrong person but when you gradually continue watching the film. His characters rub into you, converting him to be a good character. The story-line was terrific for sure one of my favourite movies of all time. The incredible story-line, highly recommend to watch it if you have not seen this before."
" Best

" 2019. 25 years later...

Now at 37, I still smile and my heart still aches when I watch the last minute of this terrific film.It's my favorite film. Was my father's as well. I watch it at least once every 5 or so years and despite knowing its every beat, I still love it as much now as I did when I first watched it.It timeless. There's just something about it. Friendship, hope, and never give up. In other words, get busy living. That's what it wants to say and succeeds in doing so."
" Fabbbbbb 😍
",,This movie must be used as an Anti-depression by therapists! this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts! or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldn't give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the Oscars.. it's simply over qualified!
" Magnifique

" Amazed
",,The dramatic experience we have never ever seen before.... Amazing ;-)
" must see
",,Probably the best movie you will ever see and must buy on DVD
" Lovely Rita, Meter Maid
",,"Currently this is the top rated movie on IMDb Top 250 -- and has been for many years -- and the reason is that this story can relate to everyone. That's not to say that, like Andy Dufresne, everyone was literally in prison, no, but in a quietly profound way it addresses a fundamental aspect of the human condition that everyone can relate to. Whether it's a housewife who's lived the same day for twenty years, or her workaholic husband who's also lived the same life for twenty years, it seems many people, judging by popularity of the film, consciously or unconsciously see this film as a metaphor for their own lives. Freedom is the issue here. Freedom from monotony, from despair, from death. Freedom to build boats or listen to Mozart or feel the sting of rain on your skin. What Andy Dufresne wanted was what we all want in our quiet moments, perhaps in the evening while we lie in bed, or in the rare instances when we have nothing to do and nothing to distract us. Andy Dufresne is us, magnified. The Shawshank Redemption is a great movie and that's what great movies do: they provide a mirror in which we can see ourselves."

" The best movie ever

This movie has drama suspense Comedy and it aced all these categories
Before talking about this movie we should mention that it wasn't the great movie in the year of its production ...hadn't a great success in cinema because in 1994 there were alot of magnificent movies
But actually this movie is the best and we easily can prove it by looking at the top 10 movies in IMDB and we could easily understand that it's the 1st since I was born
I rated this movie 10 and i was pleased watching it"
" masterpiece
",spoiler,"The Shawshank Redemption was my favourite movie for many years, but it was beaten after i watched the good the bad and the ugly; but that doesn't change anything a felt about this movie and how brilliant it really is. This movie has the best character development in movie history! It shows the way prison life has on people; especially those who have been wrongly accused, the slow decent into madness and depression as the years go by. Also, theres not many movies that make you truly hate a character because of there wicked and evil acts, Warden Norton and Captain Hadley are deceptive and cruel to the inmates of the prison, and i smiled when there story came to an end. The leading Actors such as Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman display some of the finest acting in movie history, their skills make the audience feel sorry for them at emotional times in the movie and its difficult for a movie to make the audience feel that way. As for the script, it is written perfectly and is major highlight the movie, again; this is improved further because of the amazing performances from the cast. the story is a story of loss, hope... and redemption, it may seem like a normal prison movie at first, but soon enough you'll really begin to appreciate how inspirational the movie really is. As the for the climax, The Shawshank Redemption has one of the most bitter sweet endings of all time. In conclusion, The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the greatest movies of all time, it will be remembered in the media until the end of days; this is the movie the directors of today should watch to see what cinema is all about."
" Amazing movie.

" Beautiful movie
",,One of the best exciting movie.I enjoyed it. I hope to see it again soon.
" Nice one
",,Such a nice movie. Quite interesting storyline and nice actors.
" Nothing is impossible
",,No one can take away your hope in your mind. 19 years' waiting in the jail. Nothing is impossible.The movie showcase an intense passion to crave for freedom. The man utimately regain control of his life. Every single man on earth should live a life as the male lead does. A very encouraging film.
" A beautifully heart-capturing drama
",,The film shows the sinister circumstances of prisons in the US in former times. The plot tells of an unbreakable friendship that has grown for all these years behind bars. Hope dies last...
" nice
",,"This is a great movie, I love this movie and it's one of my favorite films"
" For freedom and life
",,"The film is based on a novel by Stephen King with the same title. The film talks about human beings being free. The choice of prison was a sign of reality, where prison is a place where freedoms are robbed.
The looting of freedom contained in the film does not speak of the individual behavior of the Beshrbel talking about the robbery of the meaning of freedom, where the regime and religion impose their authority on reality.
In order to complete the picture, we find in the film harassment, punishment, a group embracing the thought of prison, the change imposed by life on people because of the loss of hope.
This is shown in Brooks' character, where he lived in Shawshank 50 years and could not accept freedom and life when he came out.
Scene interview interview with the personality of Reed is one of the most important scenes from my point of view, whenever asked by the body for reasons of acceptance to exit, we find that he is eligible to go out because he is a good person! But when Reid talks about the third time that the person who entered the prison is not the same person sitting in front of them they decided to accept him, why? Because he became a man of freedom and will.
In the end, the film explains how a person can escape from Shawshank, starting with the desire for freedom until he actually does this. Andy's 17-year-old personality has been carved into the rock until he can open a tunnel to freedom. Andi's quest for freedom has not killed him, but has made him complete his life to the end. , We can easily see this in Andy's own faith to the extent that he began to misappropriate money from the prison director personally.
There is a snapshot, a small detail summarizing all this Mozart song, which I have run, I advise you to search for the origin of this song to be impressed.
Thank you and I hope you enjoyed my review of the film."

" Just Brilliant.
",,A very compelling movie. The acting is impeccable and the suspense is real. The plot was not predictable something that is unusual for a movie. All I have to say is that this is probably one of the best movies I've seen in a long time!
" Stephen Kings best movie adaptation
",,"Based on the Stephen King novella ""Rita Heyworth and the Shawshank Redemption"". Of the many Stephen King stories that were made into movies, this is the truest adaptation. It was nominated and should have won best picture in 1993. The movie was cast perfectly with outstanding performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and Clancy Brown."
" A Study of Humanity
",,Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite films of all time. The story of Andy Dufresne characterizes the ups and downs of humanity.
" This is the review number 6264... not bad, huh?
",,"I clearly remember reading the novel by Stephen King before the movie was even conceived. Yes, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are superb in this movie, as well as any supporting actor. And yes, Frank Darabont made a stunning work to transfer the story onto the screen, but to me Stephen King remains the real reason why this film is still the number one here on IMDb. Story and characters are magnificently powerful already on the book and the film director managed to follow every page slavishly."
" BLOODY EXCELLENT

" Great!

" A real redemption
",spoiler,"I want to start my review with confessing that it was my best film ever
Also the standard time of the film is one and thirty minutes , some times I think to myself how can a film (this cilm) have such heavy meaning with this shot time in different subjects .
And other side of the powder of film was goddam good actors and also a supernatural screen play
When I Want to talk about weaknesses of this fim I can say nothing but optimistic parts of scaping from prison and the other parts but it can't be flaw maybe it's how director see things .

A two and a half hour movie which has the power to turn your long darkest hours into the most delightful moments if you are really willing to feel every bit of the movie. This movie gave me a hope and reminded me of a quote that ""tough times never last but tough people do"". There are a lot more things to learn from this movie. Don't miss them because you may never come across them in your life so beautifully. This is my first review which I strongly felt to be posted."
" A Best film I have ever seen
",spoiler,"Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus"

The characters are also very likeable, thanks to said actors. Now this film has little to no action, but it doesn't need it, everything else in the film is just as interesting, so my mind doesn't wander. The film is emotional when it needs to be, it's funny when it needs to be and it's always entertaining."
" Movie of the century

There is not one forgettable character in this movie and it is a pleasure to watch how their stories develop and intertwine with the protagonist."
" A really good movie!
",spoiler,"The Shawshank Redemption is such a good movie and it's definitely worth your time watching. Not only does it have a great plot, but the acting is very good as well because of the two main characters Tim and Morgan. I really love Tims character, Andy Dufresne. The way he thinks and acts is just cool and I think everyone can agree to it.One of my favorite scenes is when he escaped after crawling through poop. When he stood in the rain the look on his face just reassured that he actually escaped and I think it's really cool. My other favorite part was when Red ( Morgan Freeman) was released from prison and he finally reunited with Andy. I think their friendship
Is pretty cool and it will have you smiling the entire movie. My favorite quote in this movie is when Red said "" Andy Dufresne. Who crawled through a river of sh## and came out clean on the other side."" This quote really reflects what happened in the story. Andy went to prison even though he was innocent and experienced some rough things, but he ended up escaping and is now living his best life. His escape is definitely epic and I recommend this movie for everyone."

" Great but then nothing more than that
",,This is a movie where you can't point out a single flaw or mistake in it and that is rare and the only reason I gave it 6/10. Not having any flaws or mistakes or simply just not enough for it to have a higher rating. There is nothing really to interpret in the movie and everything is pretty much laid out for you. It is a classic and you can always watch it without feeling bored throughout the movie but if you are looking for a movie with a deeper meaning this is not it.
" A true classic film
",,"Took me a long time to see this movie, but finally decided to watch it and wasn't disappointed. Probably most movie fanatics know the movie so I won't focus on the movie that much, but the feeling of watching it. This one truly feels like a classic story with the storytelling, having a clear plot, but still keeping us on your toes on what is going to happen. It depicts in a real fashion on how life can be and not being boring at any point. Story guides on one direction, but every moment feels like it could turn to a different direction. Really great storytelling, creating the feeling of hopelessness, character build and classic plot from start to finish. I truly enjoyed watching this from start to finish, nothing felt superimposed."

The shifting point of view from Andy's character to Red in the beginning of the film also guides us into wondering ""Who is Andy Dufrense?"". Morgan Freeman's incredible narration paints a canvas of life behind bars and how vulnerable they are outside it. The best film of the year despite also being the most underrated. Over the years, like fine wine, it has cemented its place in the archives of cinema. If there's one thing to take from this film... ""Get Busy Living or Get Busy Dying."""
" Masterpiece
",,"Got me right in the feels. Was speechless after watching, so breathtaking in every way"
" Good Film
",,The movie is very interesting and you can watch it more than one time the story in this movie is very interesting cool too watch
" Absolutely best movie of all time
",,They just don't make movies like this spectacular piece of art
" One of the Masterpieces I have seen
",,"First thing you need to see this movie is real patience. I am not kidding. This movie will test your patience. Story moves real slow but if you watch it completely, it's real worth it."
" Fantastic Movie !
",spoiler,"Looks so great movie ! i like it to much !
I hope to be able to watch an exciting film like this again. I'm waiting for an update on the latest video from this site"
" Best Movie Ever
",,"This is one of the best movie I have ever seen. I usually do not have patience to watch a movie in one sitting. But for this one, it kept me interested and I watched it without missing a single dialogue. Morgan Freeman narration is one of the best part of this movie."
" About a very very long escape from prison
",,"It's amazing how long I could not watch this movie. However, I became interested in them only after reading the book. And the book is very good. However, the same can be said about the film. Yes, there are some nuances ..."
" One of the Greatest Movies of all Time
",,Genius. Perfect. Great Story. Great Actors. One of my favourite movies. Too bad that nowadays they'll never make a movie as half as good as this
" Best movie I have seen
",,This movie is one of those kind of movies that would move you on the power of bond and friendship. This movie tells to us that life with friends there to comfort you would make life worth all the pain and the obstacles. I was completely moved.
" the best movie
",,"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best films of all time, and is considered the best drama ever. If you ask the people on the street what is the best movie ever, you will probably hear the name of this film. Although it was built without the expectation of a high box office, it produced a great interest in the whole world, which attracted great attention (this type of film was called sleeper). morgan freeman and tim robbins' best films wouldn't be wrong. The story of two prisoners who met in prison and were close friends. An impressive scenario, flawless acting and a legend. As if you are having the movie you are caught up in the story. so much so that no one could have been touched in the final with no sense of age. Many scenes and dialogs on the internet are still breaking records on the Internet. a film that definitely and strictly needs to be monitored."
" Extremely well acted
",,"I loved this movie, its one of those movies you can watch over and again and never get tired of fantasizing about a different outcome. The reality of long prison sentences and what that does to some individuals was well depicted in this film. One of my all time favorites!"
" Mind blowing
",,The best movie ever made people think that the end makes it an incredible movie but it's not because of the end it is how Red and Andy build chemistry together it's one of the best movies about hope. This is my favourite film of all time and it should be everybody's favourite film I don't know how Forrest Gump won best picture over this nobody praises Forrest Gump anymore but people still praise the shawahank redemption because it's that good so yeah I would highly recommend this film you will not regret the it.
" BEST MOVIE EVER
",,IT IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN JUST THE END TWIST AND THE BEGINNG WHICH TOLD US IT I A SERIOUS MOVIE
" The touch of the deep side of my heart
",,"This film gave me the maximal inspirations and deeply touched my inner heart as I finally knew how to cope with everything when the whole world goes against you, and the way to get over everything when the god unleash the hell on you. For me, I am now facing the greatest challenge ornament my life as I have to conquer all sorts of difficulties to successfully get the good grades in my university"
" Hi
",,One of the nicest films ever and immortal in memory
" My Lord this is the best film of all time.
",,"How one can go through his/her life without having seen this film baffles me. On a technical level, the film is essentially flawless. but it succeeds even more on such a greater level. Film was not created for the mind, to be over-analysed and critiqued to the point of removing all feeling and stripping a piece of art down to its individual frames. Film was created for the heart, and there's a reason Shawshank is rated #1 of all time, and will never be beaten. The raw emotion and empathy we feel toward Andy throughout the film says much about the successes of humanity, and more importantly the power of hope. Everyone involved in this film caught lighting in a bottle and made quite possibly the greatest piece of art of the 20th century, if not of all time. Beats Forrest Gump any day of the week."
" wonderfulllll
",spoiler,"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie."
" shawshank
",,"Hmm..see other reviews and this give me wish for watch this film, and lets begin watch today."
" The best movie of all time
",,A masterpiece! A movie you will never forget! The best storyline and the best actors!
" Best ever
",,"This is not a depressing movie, it's about hope and the reality of life. I will be forever grateful for this movie."
" A little overrated, but still phenomenal.
",,"This film is a little bit overrated, but is still one of the greatest stories EVER told, and has one of the greatest conclusions I have ever seen in a film."
" Love this movie
",,It is always a movie i will watch when i have nothing to watch or just want to watch a good prison film. The Shawshank Redemption my best film ever
" They don't make movies like this anymore
",,It's only the best movie ever. If anyone hasn't seen it yet I don't know what the hell they are watching
" Truly a redemption!
",spoiler,"A rush of mixed feelings- confusion, disappointment, anger, huff, altogether creating a decision, and the aftermath becomes regrettable! A life sentence to prison brings an innocent heart among the minds of criminals, and strict prison security. But, as time passes, the truth and the beauty unfolds. Everyone in there is innocent. Just the lawyers screwed them! Also, the friendship grew between two people, and how they turned the prison into something else, something much more beautiful than the outer world. Spending decades in there gradually becomes living in there. The struggle, the livelihood, the fun, the everyday life, turn the people Institutional! At a point it'll feel like, We belong there! Altogether, the discipline, the rules, the cold bars of cells, the lives, the dreams, the hopes, the redemption, these all just put one's whole life in front of your eyes!
Jack may have a family now. Many people have also been there, after Red. Andy can see his customers go fishing. And yes, We now know a good use of the Bible!"
" Very good movie
",,"The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want."
" Probably the best movie of all time
",,"This film has some of the best movie line that will inspire me through all the time.
whenever i fell bore or something this film make me keep going.when i see that man who had a dream , dream that all he had.that dream, that freedom of life, that his wisdom of thought.in all those movie i watched in my life there is some of them that inspire me,that give me strength this movie is one of them.
one of the best line that is to say
hope is the best thing , probably the best of thing
and no good thing ever dies."
" Amazing movie
",,I've seen this movie several times because it inspires me.
" ...
",,"One of the best adaptations of some King's. The film is one of the trademarks of the 90's and is on the list of my favorite films because of acting, acting, choosing actors and everything else."
" Musharr
",,"Musharr, the only word you can use about this film and fiction. I saw Jondin once, and I could not see any flaws or mistakes in the movie. Definitely the film of Shoshrooz is one of the best films in the world. If the movie was high, I could say that the best film in the world is in terms of impact on the viewer."
" What a movie!!!!
",,"Oh dear, one of the finest movies that I have ever seen!The story of hope, belief, friendship and never giving up!!"
" ok
",,Cool movie i guess or i think i dont know i finish later
" good job
",spoiler,I very like watching to movie. old movie and i always watch
" The Shawshank Redemption
",,This movie really deserves to be the first on IMDB's list of 250 Top rated movies. Everybody should see it at least once in their life. My sincere recommendetion.
" Confident and compelling movie!
",,Ast and crew have done a full and fantastic job. The continuity and confidence in the story is remarkable. The idea behind the nature of the human behaviour and comprehension of its depth is clearly visible throughout the scenes.
" Good movie, but best movie?
",,"Let me start straight off by saying, I have watched this movie multiple times (10+) throughout my life and have enjoyed it every time.It's been reviewed countless times and has stood the test of time - or a couple decades at least.The characters are memorable and not easily forgotten, the story intrigues you all the way through (did he do it? Did he not?) and definetly made me at least feel four different emotions.As the title of my review suggests, I don't know if it deserves to be at the top of the IMDB best of!Would recommend.."
" GREAT Movie
",,I Have Seen this movie 3 times and each time i enjoyed it ! it's Awesome!
" Hope.
",,"A good movie about hope that shows the persistence of a falsely accused man. Tim Robbins does a good job at Andy Dufresne, but I think that without Morgan Freeman as Red (Ellis Boyd Redding), this movie would not be the same. I read the book, novella, whatever you want to call it, and it was different for the better, and there are multiple inside jokes/references to the book. The imagination of Stephen King formed into a movie that is hard to find something as good. A great movie about Hope."
" Best of
",spoiler,"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."
" Great!
",,Great movie about an escape from Shawshank prison.
" Im really cant believe with this film, unexpected
",,"I has seen many film alr, but this one is the real movie with unexpected ending.
Awesome"
" You have to see this movie.
",spoiler,"This was one hell of a movie . I mean really it got everything you need in a movie whether it thrill,drama,crime ,'prison escape' .Except for that one part about how andy knew about a pipeline after the wall."
" Amazing Movie!
",,This is one of the best mind changing and super conceptual movies seen so far! A big thumbs up for the makers of this amazing The Shawshank Redemption!
" My favourite movie
",spoiler,One of my absolute favourites. So thrilling movie. The actors are great and i think the worst part of the movies story is that the murderer doesn't get locked up.
" Great movie
",spoiler,"A very good movie, but not the best :) Check out spanish movies, you will be amazed."
" Extraordinary
",,"From a purely emotional standpoint, this is quite simply the best film ever made; epic in scope, travelling as it does over many decades of our hero's lives, it does not disappoint in any area.
The two films I return to again and again are this and Blade Runner, and despite their obvious differences, both films share many characteristics: sweeping score, wildly atmospheric, fantastic individual performances and both have aged beautifully.
A resounding, joyful, 10 out of 10 to this phenomenal film."
" An ok movie
",,I remember this. I just forgot about the whole thing. I watched last night and forgot how good this movie was. Well done!
" Hope
",,"Its a masterpiece. never miss this film. The film make me believe about hope a thing more often people ignore, but it is very much useful in real life and facing real life problems."
" best
",,"Very good and funny i love this movie
actors is stars movie"
" A Common Tale which is Extraordinary
",spoiler,"It is true that the best things are always the most simplistic things. Shawshank Redemption has always crowned the top movie lists and Yes it deserves that. When I was in college I watched this movie more than 50 times. Watching this movie is not a typical movie going experience where you start listening to a new story, get into its universe and then there is a end which completes the story. This is a ongoing story and you can watch it everytime. In the story Andy a banker is jailed for a murder he didn't commit. But the movie is not at all about this crime. Instead it is about living a life in a Prison. It tells you how people who live in inside four walls still maintain their hopes of living. When you see that a prisoner living life in high spirit you feel love and confidence and the hope is ushered inside you. This is a kind of Sad and story in which the characters are not very powerful heroes but it is about simple people living in Prison. Remarkable acting by Red, Morgan Freeman and wonderful voice overs. Remarkable OST and a never forgettable story. Each and every second you watch is important and not a single second is stuffy. You can watch it from any minute of its run time and it is pleasing. The only movie which I have rated 10 because I believe there are no things which are perfect except this one."
" It was good
",,I liked it in an aspect but was enjoyable to the end
" this movie is realy the best
",,"When i saw this... my mind was full of hope
i realy love this movie
the actors are so good"
" Unforgettable
",,"This movie is a must watch because of directing, acting and an excellent script. Morgan Freeman is the star of the movie. He played the best role of his professional life in Shawshank redemption."
" The meaning of the freedom
",spoiler,Never stop watching this movie every time they show it
" LOVE IT
",,"Based on Stephen kings 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' this movie is a modern masterpiece that I could not recommend more, upon watching it just once it has instantly become one of my favourites. Touching and heartbreaking at times, yet at others disturbing. A grim look on the lives of the prisoners. The characters leave you attached to their individual personalities each creating a sense of sympathy from the viewer. Characters such as Brooks, an old man who looks after a wounded bird within the prison, truly shine and their individual stories leave you feeling as they feel. Brilliantly directed with touching themes such as hope, friendship and humanity within prisons makes this film truly worth the hype. Could not reccomend more. Closest thing to cinematic perfection and story telling that I have come across."
" ""The Shawshank redemption"" Review
",,"The Villain in this movie played by Bob Gunton inst just the Villain because hes the warden and the protagonist is an inmate, but because of his despicable actions that make him one of the greatest villains in all of cinematic history.
Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give excellent performances as Andy Dufresne and Ellis Boyd Redding respectively.
Time in this movie is portrayed expertly by Morgan freeman's character getting parole every 10 years and the tired expression on his face just shows.
frank darabont's direction goes a hell of a long way with the direction of brooks character played marvelously by James Whitmore shows what time and captivity can do to a man it's very unsettling to think about.
the scenes with Andy and the sisters and the one where Andy is in the hole just feel so real.
this is one of the best movies ever made and also a personal favorite of mine."
" The movie must watch before die
",spoiler,"I don't know how to express my love. What incredible movie I've seen ever. Hope is a wonderful thing, maybe best thing for lives. Never give up. Nothing is impossible if hopes is alive."
" Not that good
",,"Kinda Boring i dont like the actors much and the ending was very slow, infact the whole movie was slow. morgan freeman's worst movie by a country mile."
" pretty awesome
",,It's really a amazing movie 🍿 most good ratings & rating worths ! keep watching and really a must watch movie it is .
" a wisdom sentences
",,"It had very attractive thoughts, wisdom sentences, and new way of thinking...
i like it very much...."
" Reviewing A Morgan Freeman Movie
",,"In My Opinion, the movie teaches a great lesson about friendship and survival when two people in jail together are able to endure their hardship and become friends in the process. This is a great movie to help me discover what it means to be ""human""."
" A perfect movie.
",,This movie is perfect in everything that it does and is at this time my favourite movie. I would recommend it to everybody.
" One of the greatest films ive ever seen
",spoiler,"One of the most emotional films i have ever watched. From the escape to the tool in the book to a certain old man commiting suicide, the movie had me captivated and was a rollercoaster of feelings. Its easily one of the greatest pieces of movie artwork ive ever seen and there are only a handful of other movies that come close to shawshank. Morgan freeman,James whitmore and Tim Robbins carried this to greatness."
" One of My Most Favorite Movie
",,"One of the best movie ever made. Can Call it a masterpiece. Just awesome. Movie making, Storytelling, Cinematography, Sound mixing and music all of them are too good. I like it so much. These kinds of movie give us the appreciation to watch more movie.
Quality movie."

" What a film
",,No need for a review. Just watch the movie if you haven't already!
" Best movie forever
",,Off course Greatest movie all the time.this is world top ten movies.
" very nice
",,"The shawshank very nice and this movie a shortly man, maybe lelah ...."
" A really epic movie
",,This movie is containing the real epic sessions and parts of life. It shows you to the sad life of a good man.
" Amusing Movie
",,I saw this movie when I was young and I am writing this review almost after 10 years watching that. Still I can remember the screenplay and the patience of the mastermind which succeed in the end. Very good plot and acting of the main actor as well should be praised without doubt. Though the movie is little bit lengthy comparing with the movies nowadays but I hope someone will not get bored while watching it. A 'must watch' movie.
" Slow at Start but best ending and good lessons
",,Movie is a bit slow at start but takes turn at the end. This movie has some greatest lessons for life
" It's a great movie!
",,"Good story and cinematography, I watch it several times and every time I discover new things."

" Unforgettable

" Simply the best movie ever!!!!!!
",,"The first words that I said as I walked out of the movie was this was I believe this was the best film I have ever seen. My wife friend and I had seen hundreds of movies preceding this in the '70's, '80's, and 90's."
" What more can I say?
",,Probably one of the best movies I've seen. Everything I could possibly say has been said but definitely a blueprint on jail scenes...
" it's a F masterpiece
",,"No words can describe this movie , 1994 looks so close , when i rewatch this movie i feel like it's my first time"
" A beautifully crafted Masterpiece
",,This movie is not made this is crafted and it is so much beautifully crafted that you feel mesmerising after seeing it. Entire movie will keep you spellbound. There is no doubt why the movie tops the chart in IMDb. For me this is one of the best movie I have ever seen. Beauty redefined.
" If you don't love this movie you are broken
",,"One of the finest films ever made. This jockeys for 1st or 2nd in my all time list, depending on when I'm asked. This movie is a thoughtful, poignant and brutally honest examination of the human experience in the face of extreme adversity.The overall theme boils down to ""Don't give up hope"" and that the evidence of that hope is the focusing of one's will into a sheer, unstoppable weapon for change. Andy is a wonderfully rounded out and active protagonist who you root for even before you know him well.This movie has been played repeatedly on cable, but do yourself a favor and watch the unedited version. Bring tissue in case dirt gets in your eye."
" A powerful drama
",,"A powerful drama that reminds us that hope is a precious and buoyant emotion that can give our lives substance and meaning.Many of the most powerful stories are the soulful ones that teach us not to despair, not to be swamped by sorrow. They remind us that hope is a precious and buoyant emotion which can give our lives substance and meaning. Writer and director Frank Darabont draws out strong and intense performances from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins as soulmates who support each other while doing hard time. Red sees hope as a dangerous thing that can drive a man insane, but Andy believes it is fuel that keeps one going against all odds. The Shawshank Redemption is a jubilant tribute to hope as an essential quality of soul"
" Good feeling movie

",spoiler,"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."
" Amazing
",,One of the best story lines in movie history. Morgan Freeman was probably one of the only few that could of gave the best narrations for this film. This emotional and impactful film will have you remembering famous lines and scenes.
" this is the best
",,"Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience. Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget."

" review summary
",spoiler,"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink.

" US Lawyer is sent to Shawshank prison for life, charts his experiences, friendships and influences on the prison whilst maintaining his innocence.
",spoiler,"This movie is based on a novella by Stephen King, but don't let that put you off. It's not a horror film, rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twisteroo of twists since The Crying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting off his goofball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion) is shipped to the gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank State Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a beautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to 1967.Dufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the hellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of beatings, rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire his fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red (Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given time, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to himself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in poster form.The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wiseguy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams, giving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest miracle.If you're miserable enough to look for gripes then, yes, it does drift on too long and who needs prison buggery again? Yet the ending has such poetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it flopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word."

Creates an enviroment to the story, doesn't just dump you of in a prison without setting the before.Its honest portrail of incarcerated, showing both sides of the coin and not biased is something that we need to emphasis more in our modern soiety. An eye opening movie not just because of an amazing script but also because of beautiful idea.Twists and turns, love and despair. The movie shows it all and also takes up an importnat side in our society that we don't think about. The Shawshank Redemtion is a movie that shows us raw human nature, the beauty in freedom and the darkness in imprisonment.This movie is recomended for all that appreciates true meaning in cinematography. A true master piece. And a must watch before death."
" Masterpiece
",,This is a masterpiece. Great movie and plot. Very deep and well written characters
" The bestest crime drama movie ever
",,Don't waste your time reading this review and go watch the movie
" The Shawshank Redemption
",spoiler,"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"".The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want."

",,"Brilliant movie,I'm so glad I can see on a big screen at cinema. Marvellous and how interesting,also the cast just a fab . Highly recommended to watch"
" One of the Greatest Films Ever Made
",,"This is by far the best character drama I have seen. The acting is believable and powerful, the shots are perfectly framed, the story is interesting and keeps you hooked, and the comedy, while in short supply, is appropriately dark. Andy Dufresne is a relatable protagonist, and thus it is easy to connect with his struggles, and understand how he feels about being thrown into the life of a convicted criminal. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give us incredible performances, along with everyone else in the movie. On top of that, the ending is one of the best ever put on screen. I would recommend this film to everyone who likes the industry, and consider it a must-see cinematic classic."

" Captivates

The performances are powerful and true. I do believe this to be one of the ten to fifteen truly timeless pieces that will never age. It is amazing.Definitely own it."

" The Shawshank Redemption is a marvelous story about friendship, salvation and desperation!
",spoiler,"The Shawshank Redemption is easily my favorite Drama movie ever. It is beautifully written and the acting by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing and flawless. This was my first time watching this movie and I absolutely loved it. I was glued to the screen from beginning to end.I found it surprising that Andy escaped Shawshank prison. I thought that he would get parole just like Brooks did, but I was wrong. The amount of time he spent planning his escape was undeniable and fascinating. Andy never lost hope. ""Hope can make a man insane"" is a powerful quote said by Red, but was quickly contradicted by Andy who wrote in his letter for his pal Red that ""Hope is a good thing.""After 40 years in Shawshank prison, Red finally was released. He realized that he has nothing in the outside world and misses his friend Andy. However, he did not commit suicide unlike Brooks, but honored the promise he made to Andy. Andy's quote ""Get busy living or get busy dying"" stayed in Red's head and motivated him to travel to Mexico and see Andy.The iconic shot of Andy with stretched arms and closed eyes in the rain was brilliant and symbolizes freedom. After 19 years in Shawshank prison he escaped and is finally free to do whatever his heart desires.The Shawshank Redemption is empowering and leaves the audience covered in thoughts about the strong message behind the movie. The message the movie conveys is that one should never give up and always have hope.I loved how the movie referenced the book ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" by Alexandre Dumas. While not having the exact same plot, the Shawshank Redemption and the Count of Monte Cristo both share similar aspects. For instance, in both the movie and book the main character escapes from prison.To conclude, this is by far my all time favorite drama movie and understand why it is the top rated movie on IMDB despite being a box office disappointment. For those who have not watched it, I recommend it due to the powerful friendship between Red and Andy. The Shawshank Redemption is in many ways an all time classic movie."
" A Masterpiece
",,The Best Film in Top 250 is One of the Great Films I've ever Seen in this Masterpiece you can find a way for life crisis The Shawshank redemption is a film for Relaxing especially end of it when red came to Andy I Think this sense even better than red's Escape but why many of world people love the film? I Think everyone can enjoy it length of film is 142 mins maybe more for a film with no action sense but I think no one end of it but a question for me is why darabont can't make masterpieces like it and green mile rhythm of movie is an important thing for addressed in the Shawshank redemption rhythm don't tire you and characters are not superstars with more ability than a human Andy could find a way for escape because he was an innocent man and don't kill his wife and prison is a character in this film like green mile maybe you loved like or hate this movie but I am one of the fans of darabont's masterpiece
" The best film I have ever seen

Then, when I saw the trailer of film on TV, I decided to see that. So, I saw film and was amazed. Why I havent seen this masterpiece before.Start over. Shawshank Redemption is ideal film. Ideal cast, ideal plot, all what I saw in film was ideal. I cant understand people who dont like film, Is it possible to hate this ? Who knows ?I would recommend you this film, If you still dont see.

Everything comes together flawlessly in the movie, the actors, the plot, the direction, the cinematography, all of it producing a film for the ages....if Stephen King never writes another word, he and director Frank Darabont have given the world an amazing gift in this film...A sincere thank you just doesn't seem enough but you have my undying gratitude for this movie."

" Undeserving of this placing

The two main roles are good at conveying the proper human emotions during the right scenes. It may be just a personal disliking of the plot itself, but the whole film feels rather drug out, as if the director was trying to look for thing to add in. This movie could have been a lot better if parts were cut from the finished product overall it just feels desperatley stretched."

Those who cannot tolerate either for ""mediocre writing"" or ""atrocious film-making"" should offer forth their literary or cinematic offspring instead of cunningly-worded diatribes of their deep dissatisfaction with all that does not conform to their inner reality. Then, we few who believe in and trust the creative ability of all will be able to see how those critical inner realities (so authoritative in exposition) match up with the rest of our perceptions."

",spoiler,"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie."
